Hopefully, Tesla will write a program for Supercharger reservation in future.

In the mean time, it's a volunteer system and it's up to drivers to arrange who would be next.

Most of the time, it's quite civilized but sometimes there would be arguments but fortunately, no one has pulled out a gun to assert the right for ""stand your ground"" just yet.

If your car can charge at 72A I’d set it up for that...never know when you might want to charge at full capacity. Better to have it and not need it, than the other way around....

Breaker would be; 72amp * 125% (>3hr load) = 90amp

Wire should be either #2 gauge Romex, or #3 guage THW or equivalent per the linked chart

Was the site busy when you charged? I don't think the wording of this message is helpful. To a normal owner it comes across like there is an issue with the station. Like it's not capable of charging fully. I believe it's supposed to encourage people to move their cars once 80% is reached (which is usually more than enough to make it to the next station). That needs to be focus of the message!
""

The site was about 90 % full. What I noticed was that it automatically changed the charge setting to 80%, if your setting was set above 80%. However, once the charge started you are able to change the charge limit. I charged to 85% just to see what would happen and it did continue to charge. I totally agree that 80% is good enough for most when traveling.

The lowest cost I've been able to find for an automotive fuel cell stack is Toyota claiming they can get the cost down to$8K with mass production. That's about what Tesla can do for a 75kWh battery. Then there's the issue of storing the H2. The numbers I've seen are about $20 per kWh.

Taking the two together, and adding in developing and running a new distribution system for H2 I don't see how it would be cheaper to go with H2 than batteries.

Thank you to Troy for creating and updating the pricing chart here. It shows the reduced pricing information for customers that bought before the price reduction on 2/28/19 (announced at Telsa here).

For those that have no EAP/FSD can upgrade to AP for 2k and FSD for an additional 3k.
Those that have EAP can upgrade to the newly defined FSD for 2k.
Those with FSD get early access to beta software. Godspeed to these folks.
Above pricing will be available online 'next month'.

I'm happy to see the reduced pricing for prior customers! As I've written before they have a lot of potential revenue sitting in non-activated AP systems and this seems to be another step of milking that revenue. My expectation is that Tesla will make AP free in the next 10-18 months to differentiate the brand from increasing electric competition and charge 5k or so for FSD as it is currently defined. More expensive if they add significant functionality but they seem to be years away from level 4 much less level 5 autonomy so I'd expect fancier summon, self park etc... rather than getting anything close to FSD.

I have been dealing with this rattling noise on my Tesla S 75D ever since picking it up brand new on 3/26/18. My car has been in the shop for more days than I've actually had it in my possession. Each of the FIVE model S loaner cars that Tesla has given me over the past two months have not rattled. So, it's not like Tesla can't build a car without a rattle. 

I am now dealing with the Tesla Executive Escalations Team, and I'd suggest that everyone with this problem contact that team ASAP. The more they hear from disgruntled owners, the better the chances of this issue finally being resolved. Surely, a company that has built such an otherwise-incredible piece of new technology -- and sent a rocket into space -- can fix a strut noise.

The best way to reach the Executive Escalations team is to log into your Tesla account through the Tesla website, then click on ""MANAGE"" at the top of your account page, then slide all the way down to the SUPPORT section. In the Subject Header of the Support form, click on the drop-down menu and choose, ""Escalate This Concern for Executive Review"". Then write your message, detailing everything you've experienced.

Nobody should be paying nearly $100G for a supposedly-luxury Model S that actually sounds more like a Model T.

Here's to a speedy resolution ahead!!

I responded the next minute after I got the question. Responded affirmative, agreed to the date which was in 3 days and waited for a confirmation text, or email. Nothing.

I’m surprised to see nobody complaining about AP going from 2018.50.6 to 2019.16.1.1. All of the bad behaviors that were fixed in late 2018 versions came back. Today, with AP set to a following distance of 7, I got a phantom braking episode with the (accelerating) car well ahead of me turning red on the instrument panel screen.
The car is once again unsure about whether to drift into turning lanes on highways. It has a harder time staying in the lane as well.
""

Same as Bruce for me. Sorry to read about regression for you.

AP is still the same for me, so great, with two typical AP issues still not fixed for me

- Phantom braking in this one particular event: I'm catching up two or more cars/trucks, that are on the right lane. The first vehicle decides to change to my lane. AP will notice it (it turns light grey), and adapt to that slower car. BUT as soon as that car is completely in front of me, and thus the other car in the right lane becomes visible to AP, AP locks on it too (turns also light grey), and because I'm actually catching up to that vehicle at that time, AP brakes hard, thinking it has to keep distance to it too (while it should not, as it is not in my lane). If I let AP do it's stuff, it thus brakes hard (not nice for people behind us), and a second or two later, it unlocks from that vehicle (turn dark gray again) and resume acceleration, as that hard braking left much space in front of me. I know the situation and work around it by keeping my foot on the accelerator, so effectively preventing AP from managing the ""throttle"".

- Hill crests. Though it improved begin of 2018, it still will veer to left or right on most ""hills"", even if it is a clear straight road ahead. Same as above, known scenario, so ready to take over.

I still hope Tesla fixes those, I think it's doable, but I understand it's probably lower in their backlog.",,0,0,0,0

Yes, either of those are possibilities, but I am not sufficiently confident in my skills with high-voltage / high power wiring to do this myself. Also, at $500, the wall charger is about $100 more expensive than the OpenEVSE kit. While the wall charger can charge at 48A vs. the OpenEVSE kit that charges at 40A, neither the currently installed 50A breaker nor the 14-50 socket are rated for more than 40A continuous. Thus, the higher potential charge rate of the wall charger would require additional expenditures for installing a new 60A breaker and the associated wiring. Based on all this, the OpenEVSE kit seems like the simplest and most cost effective solution.
""

Don't get me wrong, I love the OpenEVSE and I'm sure you'll like it. I have one myself that I'm having on outlet put in for because my Model 3 is finally coming. I would note, though, that building the kit requires the same skill set as wiring the wall connector would.",,0,0,0,0

I have to take delivery by 6/30 for the tax credit, so let's get these things moving!
""

As do many of us

30 April confirmation - no VIN. Configurator estimated May delivery. Let’s do the odds on that. It’s Saturday, Monday is a holiday and Tesla website says you see your VIN online about 6 weeks before delivery. However, some customers say they get a delivery before the VIN appears. Some say east coast shipments happen only once a month or once a quarter. The delivery specialist isn’t really saying. She did confirm early this week that I still didn’t have a VIN match.

Perhaps if we don’t have them by end of June, Tesla will execute another tax drop offset? But seeing that I have an existing price contract I wonder if it would apply to me? Doesn’t look like they are applying the current $2k reduction. ,aye I’ll ask her the next time we talk, if it isn’t for a delivery date.

Connecting a Qi inductive charger also did not initiate current flow. If the X6's Power button was pressed, the empty Qi charger would maintain a power connection indefinitely until disconnected. However, leaving the Qi charging pad connected drained the X6's 20,100mAh battery by ~5% per day.

Connecting an ASUS MeMO Android tablet _always_ started charging automatically.

After elaborate testing, I have concluded that the Zendure X6 is NOT APPROPRIATE in this application for Lightning-connected iOS devices. 

I am now using another USB battery pack (which I already owned) which requires no button press to charge iOS devices. At this point, I'm not using a separate USB drive for music data, so I have no immediate need for the X6's data hub functionality.

A 121 kW peak is right in line with what I expect now. Assuming the MR has a 37 cell brick, we can ratio down the 150 kW seen on the LR 46 cell brick. That equals 120.6kW, so the current MR profile allows a similar c-rate as the LR cars at 150 kW.

There are two sides to this story however. I'm sure from the city of Custer's point of view they want us to come prior to Memorial Day.

Tesla paid for a rental car which cost over $2300.00, while my car sat in my garage. So my recommendation would be, know how long the temporary tags will be from the state your car is in if you will go get it.

Richmond needs a supercharger without even taking into account BC 99 traffic. Many Teslas there. And when you take Bc 99 traffic into account, then it needs it even more. Crossing the border definitely isn’t as convenient, or even possible, sometimes.

Brand new owner, my car is now getting tint, chrome delete and others so can't play around with it. During my limited 1 hour with it today, I struggled to get Bluetooth audio to give me enough controls to imagine using Apple Music regularly. On the contrary, I was quite happy with the audio quality and selection of Slacker as far as radio, so I can probably live with that. However, many questions for those who regularly use Apple Music and/or Bluetooth with an iPhone...

I was able to easily play my last played/current playlist. Album art and moving between songs in the playlist worked. That's about where it ended. Seemingly missing were:

1. No way to put random play mode on
2. No way to navigate through playlists
3. No list mode to quickly find a song in the playlist
4. No search option
5. No ability to switch playlists
6. No ability to switch to Apple Music Radio from Playlist

I realize I can do all of this on the phone, but that's quite distracting and requires FaceID, grabbing the phone from the cubby, etc. I imagine I might be able to Siri some of that stuff, but I find that more stressful than grabbing the phone. My Volvo and Cadillac provide pretty comprehensive access to change playlists, look for songs, etc. through both on-screen UIs and steering wheel controls, I couldn't find anything similar. Am I missing anything, I find it barely usable except to start a playlist before driving and just live with it and maybe skip a song or two.

Any tips for a new user?

The side repeater cameras used for Sentry look towards the back of the car, so front and back are fairly well covered though not 360 degrees.

If there is a long enough cable on the charger (I've seen a few long ones), you may be able to park front-first. Otherwise I guess you'll be backing in.

It is long enough and I can park either way and it will reach. Also it would require about the same length either way since the port is in the driver's rear . The problem is my current car was hit in the rear by someone coming around the corner. I want to be able to see if this happens again. So would I get FULL rear view in Sentry Mode?

Precautions: I live on the 4th floor and was parked on Level 4. I have since started parking on Level 6 (highest charging station) and not many people park on Level 7 so the number of cars passing my car in WAY lower.

Really? That's interesting, if so... but that then raises the question as to why only the 90 packs (and the associated 75 packs) are affected so drastically compared to the 85s and presumably the 100s?
""

Well, they clearly made some change 85-> 90 that gave 6% extra energy storage, for a lighter weight. This happened right when I ordered my 2015P85D January 2015; I had the option of a 85 or a 90 pack, and was warned ""the 90s are experimental"" so I chose to go with tried and true. At least that's the way I remember it.

As I recall, my P85D had revision 9 of the original model S chemistry (I think it went alphabetically); I figured ver 2.9 was likely to be more reliable than 3.0 Looks like that turned out to be correct. It was discussed on TMC that the change was more silicon in the anode, and there was a discussion how that technology had been under development for years and worked well, but the silicon would expand when maximally charged, and repeatedly expanding and contracting (in the lab) led to cracks of the anode.

3690946,Waiting for m3 red exterior white interior,bitfrenzy,2019-05-25 10:15:00,"I ordered a Model 3 Performance (Red/White) on April 19th. This is my first Tesla. The delivery estimate at the time of ordering was within two weeks but forums such as this one indicated that the wait could be much longer. I was pleasantly surprised when I received a text message on April 26th that my car would be ready for delivery the following Friday (May 3), which would be exactly two weeks from the order date. This appeared to be a good sign.

Unfortunately I was scheduled to be out-of-town for a week. When I asked to reschedule the delivery for when I returned, I was told they could only hold the car for 7 days and they would try to get me another by the time I could receive delivery (which was right at 7 days from the scheduled delivery date). Fast forward and they delivered my car to someone else. My rescheduled delivery date (May 10) came and went without a car. Inquires as to status were met with offers to give me some other type of exterior/interior but no real insight into when I could expect the car to be delivered.

It was only just today (May 25th) that I received another text message that my car is on the way for delivery. Unlike the first time where a delivery date and time was pre-determined by Tesla, this time I was able to pick a day and time on their website. The car is (tentatively, in my mind, at least until I receive it) scheduled for delivery on June 4th.

Some observations/frustrations:
1. The local delivery team lacks any kind of customer service. Inquiries as to status and estimates are met only with responses like ""In review of your account, I do not see a VIN yet assigned."" I can also see this from logging in myself so there's not much value add to reaching out to them.
2. When I ordered the car online, I was told home delivery was not an option (I don't really care as I live 20 miles from the service center and don't need or even prefer home delivery). However, both delivery notifications show the car being delivered at my house, not at the service center.
3. I'm not sure how car productions are scheduled, but it doesn't appear that ordering your car places you roughly next in line for production (behind the others who have already ordered their cars). Rather, car production seems to be scheduled by some process at the factory that is presumably more efficient for them but can result in wide variations for delivery times from customer to customer, depending on the configuration ordered and location of the customer. I can't get any confirmation of this, however.",,2,0,0,0

Congart. Just curious: Which version/color/wheels/7-seats...
Is it your first Tesla? What other car do you have or had?
Can you charge at home or work? Or plan to install a plug?



Model Y AutoPilot is a $3,000 option and Full Self Driving is $5,000 or $8,000 for both.

Model S/3/X AutoPilot is included and Full Self Driving is $6,000

So, Model Y price might be adjusted to include AutoPilot?

There might be a Standard Range or a Mid Range for a lower price, after may be one year?

Some options might be added, like trailer hitch, and possibly Fully Adaptive Suspension?



Just a guess, between 50,000 and 100,000?



Elon Musk mentioned that Tesla can only survive for another 10 month,
so I guess there will be an expected new cash input in about 10 months,
which could correspond to the start of the Model Y delivery to customers,
but this would be then around March 2020?

However, during the unveiled, it was announced that the Model Y
is expected to hit production in late 2020, so march 2012 might be possible in California?

Does anyone actually offer a 3rd party warranty that will cover a Tesla?
""

Some jurisdictions do not allow companies to call these 3rd-party contracts a warranty. It's easier for some people to wrap their head around the notion that they are in fact more of an extended service contract. 6 of one - ½dozen of the other. Companies like to call them a ""warranty"", because there are stricter enforcement rules under various States' Insurance Commissions - & in essence, the 3rd party company is assuring you that your car will be fixed when broken, just as State Farm insurance assures your house will be fixed - if someone drives through it, or it burns down - as our renters did to our Nashville home last year;


Sure - we had to fight with them for nearly a year, but it all worked out.
And like the probability of negligent renters causing destruction, an actuary will calculate odds of your model 3 ending on the side of the road prematurely (after factory warranty), just like they calculate the odds of negligent renters, or tornados, earthquakes damage or lightning.
Since all of the model 3 cars are still under warranty, an actuary cannot adequately determine whether or not the model 3 will incur large costs, or run problem free for another 150,000 miles Beyond your policy. Risk aversion versus profit lost. These Arrangements after all, are designed to make money for their respective companies. (As a 'warranty' some fly-by-night companies would simply declare bankruptcy when they failed to determine cost adequately. The insurance industry, although some have tried to do that can't do it so easily.). Many people feel these policies are BS. We've had 2 different cars with extended policies. One was for a Range Rover, the other for our Prius. Both of the policies more than paid for their self. Usually though, that's not the case, FWIW. Eventually there will be policies available for the 3 Once they figure what the cost should be and still yield a profit to the companies offering.

Tesla - comma wiki
http://tinkla.us/index.php/Welcome_to_Tinkla!

K, and now for those who like to read...

Why I'm writing this? Due to a lot of peoples effort I was able to have all my driving dreams fulfilled, however not many know about this path so I want to expose it to you to pay it forward for all those who have for me.

Since the day I heard about Tesla and the roadster I dreamed about owning one. I think most of you can relate to this, with exception to those who just went and bough them... If your one of those people, THANK YOU!

Then the S came out! WOW something as cool as a roadster but I can actually fit a family and groceries in it! Now if I only had 100K to spend on a car . First world problems, right?

So fast forward, to October 2018. Finally as the white stickers were expiring (California thing) lots of people were deciding to replace their HOA car since soon it will be useless to them, also Tesla was going to loose the $7500. This put a lot of used Tesla S's on the second hand market driving prices way down. And FUD made the high mileage S's very undesirable, which was great thing for me. Since I have been going full electric since my gateway car in 2006, a Prius... I have very high confidence the S will last me many more mile (500K I'm aiming for you!)
After getting my S I was mildly disappointed it didn't have any driving features (2013 = pre AP1.) However that feeling was quickly replaced after getting in the car each time.

Then 1 day, on a whim I decided to try OP and got all the parts. Well not totally on a whim. I heard about OP even when I was researching S's back in Oct but did not want to try yet as I was waiting for ""Longitudinal control"" Advance Cruise Control. The pages were a little of date implying it was not working. I will give a disclaimer that it is still being developed. After seeing BogGyver's videos I decided I really need to look into this more.

Almost all my parts arrived early April, but I was lacking parts to enable the steering. I decided to just hook up what I had so I can start earning some comma points, and help train the comma driving models. Keep in mind this was a non-tested configuration so I don't recommend you doing this. However I felt confident with the understandings I had and talked to the developers. With this basic setup EON, Panda, and Giraffe I had the better Cruise Control than stock! Remember at this point OP only has regen so you literally may need to step in any second!

I started with OP version .5.9 and quickly felt confident to go to .5.11 alpha. Reason was the lane control was so good with just 1 camera! At this point I have Lane control, which keeps my car almost perfectly centered in the lane at all times (More on this later.) Cruise control which will control my speed down to 18 mph (Regen only.) Below 18 mph is all manual. The tesla can use lane control only or lane control and speed control. I don't feel a need to use speed control only, except for a couple situations (more on that later.)

After almost 2 month and over 3500 miles I'm using lane control almost all the time. I still often keep my hands very near the steering wheel when I'm in heavy traffic. That is more for the even someone decide to share my lane while I'm in it. Yes the S is a small car that many people cant see, or maybe they just don't care (you can PM me for my private dashcam collection where 2 cars decide to mate on the highway.) I have added pedal (speed control to 0 mph.) Still works best when on free highway

Lane control is down to 0 MPH out of the box. I literally use this feature every drive there are lane markings. Since .5.11 curb detection has much improved. 1 lane tracking is decent enough to use about 60% of the time. When using lane control only I am in full control of speed. I can apply brakes at any moment which gives me extra time to grab the wheel if needed. There has rarely been the need. After a while you have a good understanding where OP will have trouble, which is mostly very faded lane lines. I also don't like using in the rain, that still feels very un-natural for me. Exits on right, most of the times the car will stay in lane by tracking the left lane. AZ freeways are really nice since the exits are also marked with dotted lines like the roads were marked for autonomous driving! The only time I use my steering wheel is to make sharp turns or change lanes. Automated Lane changing is operational however needs refinement so I don't use it yet.

Cruise Control without radar is good when there are not a lot of cars around. I don't experience phantom braking under bridges and stuff. I do experience it when going into turns and OP thinks a turning car in adjacent lane is in front of me. There seems to be limitations with depth and the single camera. OP is designed with premise that radar is available. Tesla branch was working around this as non AP cars don't have radar. There is current development and basic radar support is already implemented. I'm just waiting for the rest of my parts to arrive so I can retrofit it on my car. Sometime vision does not detect cars properly, so be EXTRA watchful when using cruse without radar. Think of it as slightly advance cruise control. Actually even AP 1,2,2.5, or 3 is not L4. Letting them do their own thing is just not the design intention...

The full OP driving experience will be once I retrofit iBooster for braking and parking sensors for 360 degree detection. I hope to add real radar based blind spot detection in the future, let me know if you have experience and want to help.
Soon my driving dreams will be fully realized! Tesla and very assisted driving!!

if the vehicle rolls in the opposite direction of the transmission and immediately apply either A) Hold (which is the e-brake I believe), B) Minimum motor torque to stop motion, or C) Brakes.

Hold is just the regular brakes, not the e-brake. If they use the motors to hold the car in position, it's going to create an immense amount of heat, so that's not likely a good idea. The solution is to apply the brakes, which is what HOLD already does. But adding an automatic hold mode when the car detects it's on a steep hill wouldn't be a bad idea!

Neen, de snelheid moet zo ingesteld worden voor de test dat aan die snelheid de laterale acceleratie aan die snelheid te hoog wordt. De test is geslaagd als desondanks (en zonder bestuurdersinput) de laterale acceleratie niet wordt overschreden.

Er staat trouwens niet bij ""de test is geslaagd als de Autopilot er in het midden de brui aan geeft"", dus het huidige gedrag is ook niet conform, maar als de laterale acceleratie toch binnen de perken blijft (wat als er obstakels naast de baan zijn trouwens niet kan door uit de bocht te vliegen —tegen een vangrail klappen geeft ook wel laterale acceleratie).

Als er obstakels zijn en de weg mag niet verlaten worden dan is de enige oplossing het verlagen van de voorwaartse snelheid.

Heel duidelijk verwoord is het niet, maar je moet het ook niet op de meest absurd mogelijke manier interpreteren. De manier die Tesla nu aanhoudt is trouwens ook vrij absurd en volgens mij ook niet conform.

3691185,Configure Powerwalls To Ignore Solar?,NuShrike,2019-05-25 12:06:00,"wwhitney said:
↑

If you want to get Powerwall to ignore your solar production and just track your consumption, you need to set set the solar CTs to Load or Site with the correct sign choice.

When your have solar production, the main Site CTs detect your net consumption (consumption minus solar production), and so to calculate your actual consumption, the Powerwall adds your production from the Solar CTs to the main Site CTs to get your total consumption.

So setting the solar CTs to Load or Site with the correct sign should reproduce this behavior as far as calculating total consumption, while not telling Powerwall you have solar.

If you just disable the solar CTs, then the Powerwall will only see your net consumption.

Cheers, Wayne

P.S. I assume on step 6/12 in the wizard you deleted your solar generator?
""

I'll try that today, after I finish getting my app to talk to the local wizard-API. Looks like there's no way to set the backup_reserve_percent, from my usage of it. No matter what I set the value to, it's now always 5% when changing/setting to self_consumption mode.

Addendum: the wizard doesn't allow coexisting Site and Load CTs. They're exclusive modes to all the CTs.
eg. If any CT is set to Site, the only options available for any CT is Site/Solar/None. If any CT is set to Load (after resetting them all to None), then only options for any CT is now Solar/Load/None.

Yes, I tried deleting the solar-generator on that page of the wizard. The Neurio always says ""4 CTs"" no matter if they're physically connected. Neither affects locally restoring grid-charging.",,0,0,0,0

Bob_00 said:

Cars received with no significant issues, just a little confusion. When I ordered, my home address did come up when entering my delivery details as I live in a new development. Happen's somewhat regularly with on-line orders so no surprise, I just enter my work address instead. When a DA was assigned, I advised of the address change and she was able to manually enter my details so I figured all was well. Got the call on Thursday that they would be coming Friday afternoon, so I went in Friday and ducked out early to come home and empty out my trade in and get ready. 

About 15 minutes after getting home, a co-worker called and told me a truck with 2 Tesla's pulled in to my work lot. Even though I was told they would be sent to my home, and was advised they would call in advance to confirm the time, they showed up at my work, unannounced. No big deal, I just drove back to the office.

Both cars were unloaded and waiting in the lot when I got back. The delivery guy had no real interest in giving me much of a chance to look at the cars, or even relish in the moment, he just shoved the papers in my hand and said sign. I did a quick walk around to ensure nothing was glaring, and luckily all looked good. So I signed, and handed over my trade in keys, to a blank stare. He had no clue he was taking my car in trade. I called my DA and she confirmed that he was to take it, and he called his office and they weren't sure, but based on my DA's insistence, they agreed to take it, so off he went with my trade in, and there I was with 2 shiny new Tesla's... and slowly but surely, people started migrating out of my office and drooling over the cars.

I gave them a good look over in the lot while others peppered me with questions and comments. Only issue I noted on one was a little bit of adhesive from the chrome trim around the rear passenger window had dripped onto the paint. Very minor. So with that it was time to head out. It was the first time I had ever touched a Tesla, let alone drove one. We got an SR+ and an AWD. My biggest mistake was driving the AWD first. I got in and very slowly and gingerly navigated around the lot and got on the road. I took it easy for the first couple hundred feet to get a feel for the regen, then I decided to test the acceleration. No matter how much I read, or how many videos I had watched, I was no where close to ready for it, the acceleration is ridiculous. Even kind of scary. I can't even begin to image what the performance model would be like. I got home, and looked the car over a bit more, noted a slight bulge in the rubber around the rear driver door, and slight paint imperfection on the side of the same door frame, but again, very minor and not something I'm at all concerned with. 

When I went back and picked up the SR+, I basically did the same dance out of the lot, and when I tried out the acceleration, it was still surprising, but not as much as the AWD. The SR+ is still the fastest I've ever owned or driven, but the AWD kind of stole its thunder. I wish I had of brought them home in the reverse order, just to get blown away twice. The SR+ is pretty much flawless. I'm sure some one with a more particular eye may find fault, but for me, I have nothing to complain about.

We are still learning the vehicles, but I am absolutely floored how amazing the whole experience has been.

3691238,Why is Navigation so bad?,AustinP,2019-05-25 12:25:00,"OTARon said:
↑

I love how on trips the navigation will tell me go here to the next super charger and all, but here is a list of things I don't like, and don't know who or how to tell Tesla

a. I want way points in trips. Las Vegas To Washington State, via Eureka CA not I5 for example we don't always want the fastest most direct route.
2. When I'm driving with using Nav, I want the map to not change its orientation or range as I drive. I like to set my distance say 3/4 of a mile distance not 40 miles so I can read street names. let me use the 17"". I set my zoom, stop resetting it.
iii. How about traffic data be accurate, I will see a road that is Orange but there is no traffic on it. is that historic data ""last Tuesday at 4pm traffic was busy there""
4. Could you do something about how my map randomly spins “round, round, baby like a record” on the big and little screen!!

This is my list so far, I am sure there is more but so far this is it.

Okay, a couple of ways to improve it, but I disagree with the title: navigation is definitely not bad, it works pretty darn good. If you insist on waypoints try another option such as a better route planner

But yes, WAYPOINTS PLEASE TESLA!
""


I also totally disagree with the title.
The nav is great and the best around.
It sure can be improved and waypoina t would be nice. But not essential. Nothing prevents you to plan your route and chose as destination the next stop you want in the nav.
And indeed if you want to plan, you can do it with abetterrouteplanner.com

I find it not constructive such arbitrary judgement totally unbalanced.
In my previous Audi there was waypoint. But the system was really poor at routing, obsolete out of the box and of course not updating unless you paid for a 2 years old outdated update. And the waypoints turned out cumbersome and I dropped using them.

Please be more mindful before judging.
I’m sure Tesla people are reading and this is not constructive.

↑

These are arbitrarily picked numbers.
""

Yeah, I know. It is arbitrary, just as the Wh/rmi chosen by Tesla is largely arbitrary. Obviously the Wh/rmi are based roughly on EPA miles and the capacity of the battery, but is actually at Tesla’s discretion, as they can 1) implement a reserve energy below zero miles, 2) make the Wh/mi indicator in the car read low or high as they see fit, etc. The Wh/mi indicated could be off by 10x and it would make zero difference - it is just a number. It could say you use 1000MWh/mi, for all the difference it makes. 

I just thought it was likely that the scalar Wh/rmi on the RWD vs the AWD, if they are different, is likely to be in the ratio 310/325 because those are the two numbers Tesla has chosen. But it is not required to be that relationship.

We’ll see. Hopefully someone can say what it is on the SR and the LR RWD. I know it is somewhere between 230 and 235Wh/rmi for the AWD (P3D).

Even though the value is arbitrary, knowing the actual scalar used IS useful, because once you know it, it tells you what you need to get for efficiency to achieve the rated miles in a single drive (to the extent the state of charge indicator is linear, of course). I have to do better than ~230Wh/mi to get 310 miles out of a single charge on my car.",,0,0,0,0

When I originally got NOA via firmware update the service tech had to come load the newest version of the maps because for some reason it wasn’t downloading (despite being garaged with plenty of bandwidth on WiFi, specifically on a guest network that isn’t shared) and it wasn’t compatible with the version I had loaded. After he did that, we still couldn’t get it to work. It took actually disconnecting the 12volt to get it to appear, I guess a hard reset.
""

I had a similar problem... I searched the forums trying to find out why my NOA was not working... my car reported that I needed updated maps and should connect to wifi to download them. But my car has wifi every night. I tried putting a wifi repeater near the car to strengthen the signal in the garage to get the maps to download - nothing.

Finally, I sent an email to Tesla service. After about a week they replied and said they had looked into it and my car had the newest software and maps available. I replied that my car showed Navigation data : NA-2018.6-702, which was not the latest. I think their database showed something different than what my car had. Maybe the result of a failed download at some point?

Anyway, they said they would perform 'additional diagnostics'. The next day, while my car was in the parking lot at work (no wifi), the navigation data went away completely (which was a problem because I had to navigate to a doctor's office after work). I guess they deleted it remotely. Back at home I thought the maps would update over wifi overnight, but no. However, the next day in the parking lot the maps updated via LTE. And now NOA works fine.

After clearing up my mind, I am going to terminate this product and replaced by a better solution. The new solution is the ""Multi-camera solution""

This multi-camera solution is to display the camera images on the Tesla screen by the respective display mode can be switched by the control on the steering wheel.

The multi-camera solution can adopt up to 3 pieces 720p cameras (frontview, left-view, right-view), altogether with the factory rear-camera, as a result of maximum 4 cameras for the blind-spot monitoring, with the output LVDS signal directly to the AP Engine or the HDMI Interface Box. Which means, if you don't have the HDMI Interface Box, you can still use this multi-camera box in order to perform up to 4 camera views (front/left/right/rear) for upgrading the blind-spot monitoring for daily use.

Each of the display view is implemented by triggering the CAN signal. For rearview is triggered by ""R"" transmission, leftview by left turn indicator, right0-view by right turn indicator, and front-view by D/N transmission.

3691383,Renting a Model 3 - how to supercharge?,Big Earl,2019-05-25 13:14:00,"proudapron said:
↑

We're going in a trip with it (about 400 miles round trip) and will hit a few superchargers on the way. I was able to get an update from the owner and they are willing to do the unlimited supercharging for only $30 total now, I'm assuming that's a pretty fair price since the car needs to be returned on a full battery to avoid a fee?
""

$30 for 400 miles is fair.

400 miles divided by 4 miles per kWh is 100 kWh of energy. 100 kWh times 28 cents per kWh (national average, if I remember correctly) is $28.",,0,0,0,0

The punishing rains are consistent with the effects of climate change, since warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture — and release it.

ALTON, Ill. — To say that there is a powerful river in the Midwest that is threatening to flood communities nearby hardly narrows it down.

The Illinois, the Missouri, the Arkansas and the Mississippi Rivers were all at risk of spilling over in the coming days. The prospect put a patchwork of local and state officials on high alert on Friday, as they prepared sandbags, assembled barriers and nervously eyed the rising waters.

GolanB, I will get back to you after my next charge.
I did not run the Tesla app at all after my last charge and as expected, after 36 hours, I still have 25% charge left, which equates to what I originally described; 48 hours of battery time.

Generally I am not within range of my car when not driving. The front screen notification says Tesla disconnected.
I normally terminate the app, but I don't go in that often.

Ooh nice. A couple questions:

- what is the effect of front toe out? Does the car tramline on the road? I like sensitive steering with near zero toe, but toe out is usually too much for me on other cars. Yet I see the M3 has a stock toe range including toe out! Wondering about steering dynamics. 

- does the car tend to push? +2 degree negative front camber vs rear should counter it if so... and since its high power AWD, wondering if a little push is OK? Maybe you'd trail brake and then get on the throttle really early after apex to bring the front around?

(Side note - the pushiest car I ever drove was a Yugo in a Lemons race on Walmart tires. It would start to slide at 25mph in a corner. The only way to drive it fast was to give it more throttle when it started to push. It would still understeer, but it would also bring the front around. Totally counter to normal weight transfer strategy. We were also totally destroying tires!)

- how sensitive is handling to ride height differential front to rear? My Miata is extremely sensitive to ride height changes, to the degree that 1/4"" change in front ride height can make the car tail happy vs neutral. But the M3 is way heavier, so not sure if it would be as dramatic?

- how neutral is the car as stock?
""

I'll do my best to answer these questions.

I was planning to do an alignment with 0 toe in the front, but it was late and I was running out of time so I just matched factory for ease. I have since done another alignment, and set it to 0, and it feels great!

I really don't find the car pushing much. It definitely pushed a little on stock suspension, but at this point the car is predictable and neutral. For a 4,100lb car, you don't feel the weight nearly as much as you might expect. I think a lot of that has to do with the weight being down low and the low center of gravity. I am planning on dropping down to 265 tires (from 275) as I don't feel the additional weight and rolling resistance of the 275's is worth it.

I haven't found the ride height to make a big difference. It felt really good stock, and now it feels better. It isn't a drastic improvement, but a noticeable improvement. I dropped the car about 1.5"" all around. That said, the traction/stability/motor control when using Track Mode is phenomenal. It actually seems to add to the driving experience and it will let you get pretty out of control before intervening. The car kind of just pulls you around the track (in a good way). I found it to be faster down the straights than most cars (the exceptions being Camaro ZL1's and similar 600hp+ cars), and it can keep in the twisties with the best of them (Miata's/E36's/etc). 

Overall, for a car that I can (comfortably) drive home, it's incredible. Oh yeah, I am also saving $200+ in gas each track day!",,1,0,0,0

(1) You could wait until it's available and then purchase. No harm in that, and the system allows for that.
(2) You can purchase at time of vehicle. No harm in that.

Ultimate, you may never understand and appreciate the decision that resulted in why someone wanted to purchase it early.

Part of the problem is the highlighted blue bar comes on when Navigate on AutoPilot is enabled. But the car graphic shows just two blue lane markers, basic AutoPilot, which does not handle automatic lane changes.


Again, only the blue lane markers, basic AutoPilot.


Here is the first indication that Navigate on AutoPilot is working. The lane markers are grayed and a single, path blue line shows up.


Here the car has flipped back to basic AutoPilot.

Typo here--I meant Feb 2019.


Much of the thermal energy during use or charging likely comes in/out through the liquid cooling system so I could see two ways to increase the cell-level cooling: increase the cell contact area by making the cooling tubes ""more wavy"" or increase the flow rate of the cooling fluid. Since the thermal load for the SR pack is only 2/3rd of the LR design, I would think it'd be much easier just to increase the flow rate as the pumps and heat exchanger would be oversized for the SR heat load. This is just speculation, maybe they did expand out the cell placement for additional safety or cooling. The blue boxes in the graphics I posted above assume the same cell density.

Well, I'm certain they had very good predictions for the car's range when they announced it in Mar '16. Whenever they locked down the 31-cell brick configuration, they knew what the range was going to be. I suspect that was in mid '17 or earlier. As you suggest, I think what happened very late was the idea of splitting the SR into two separate configurations extract greater margins from the SR cars.
""

I was digging through those EPA applications too... My hunch is that they actually retested an SR+ car with SR firmware with the EPA and the different numbers we see are just variance or due to the firmware... I can see a scenario where because they're gimping the SR models to 5.6s 0-60 vs the SR+'s 5.3s the SR model's motor control algorithm might be forced to be less efficient. 

We're in some interesting times with EVs and OTA updates. I'm 90% sure that the 5% performance increases and high speed performance improvements come from better motor control (probably sensorless) algorithms being implemented for high speed . I'm sure that the LR model highly EPA numbers are probably slightly better than listed after those patches. 

I'm just speaking from my toying around with different BLDC control methods, since the model 3 uses some type of SRM I have no idea what they could do to make it better...",,0,0,0,0

↑

According to my understanding, when pulling into a charging stall at a heavily used supercharger location, Tesla will change the charge limit from whatever percentage you had to 80% via their over-the-air internet connection to the car. My question is whether Tesla will reset the percentage charge limit to the setting you had before charging. I suspect not, which may tick off a lot of people. The readers of this forum will know to reset the charge limit if necessary (for example, my default setting for daily charging is 89% but when at a supercharger I charge to have a 30% range indication over the actual drive distance to the next supercharger (as I consume more battery energy than the car estimates), which could be less than 89%). People that don’t read this forum will just drive away not realizing they need to reset their charge limit setting, and thereafter call Tesla complaining about the capacity of the battery.
""

If all this is true then I think the TITLE of this article is more misleading the what Tesla may actually be doing. Generally when I stop at a SuperCharger I check to see the limit and make sure it is correct. My guess most would do that anyway so this does not appear to be a concern at all. And when I did get a notice it said... You are about to reach 80% charge so come back to your car (or something like that). Which I can look at my Phone to verify my setting.",,0,0,0,0

Not only did he probably determine the outcome of the last presidential election in the U.S., but he has now determined who are traitors to mother Russia based on evidence to be provided by William Barr.

Normally I avoid such bold assertions, especially the latter, since there is enough manufactured paranoia mixed with real fears, but new evidence emerges daily.

On the first point. Obviously there are many factors determining Hillary’s loss and many, including herself, are more important determinants than the many factors leading to the shift of a mere 14,000 or so votes in a few key states. Also more powerful is Comey’s bumbling interventions. But when there are many factors, some incidental forces may be crucial. We now know from court filings that Paul Manafort gave Russian operatives information on private campaign polling and crucially in states where those 14,000 votes were to be found.

When on a knife edge, local perturbations become causal, future historians may conclude.

On the second point about Trump’s recent memorandum weaponizing with classified documents his war on Mueller, my paranoia has become real fear along with notice our intelligence services have the same concerns.

Potential Clash Over Secrets Looms Between Justice Dept. and C.I.A.

The specific individual referenced may already be blown. There has been one report a highly placed Russian intelligence official was hooded and removed from a meeting with his peers in Moscow. (Hooded because they feared his hand to hand combat skill.)

Tax credit will have very little impact on Q3, the real problem is that Q2 had a lot of reservation holders for /SRSR+ globally and all versions in the UK while Q3 has almost none.
Even demand for Q2 is far from clear at this point as the 50k orders mentioned in the email could contain 20-30k reservation holders. Tesla isn't doing much to help demand yet, they are still focused on maximizing margins so they are either screwing up or demand is sufficient for now.
Q4 might have lots of reservation holders in China, assuming most are waiting for local output and lower prices.

End of June rush is unlikely as Tesla entered Q2 with some 17-18k M3 inventory plus in transit and they are not gonna drain that. They would likely push on the refreshed S&X side, if demand is higher than production but it's unclear where demand and production are right now for these - the recent price cuts for S&X do suggest demand a bit bellow production.

Tesla needs to stop maximizing margins at the customer's expense and work on the very opposite to nurture demand for both Model 3 and Model Y . They also need to do 100 times more on the PR and IR side or the press is gonna kill them.
With M3, the gap in range between SR and LR is maybe too high, SR and SR+ are not quite appealing enough while LR costs quite a bunch. A smaller gap would hit mix so ASPs and margins while increasing costs, quite problematic but they might have to do it, maybe at least revive the Mid Range model.

3691739,Questionable service charges over insurance claim at NYC area SC,Sutton 3P,2019-05-25 16:10:00,"I've visited an NYC area service center several times over the past half year with small issues such as a white mark of what appeared to be car paint on my glove box (which they replaced free of charge) and my screen frequently rebooting during driving (pushed an update). About a week ago my AP stopped working and Tesla remotely diagnosed it as a problem with the radar. This triggered another visit to the SC and this last visit has made me a little worried about the business practices at this SC.

I have to say the process went really well up until when they emailed me the bill  They covered my Lyft and even loaned me a model S (albiet a 2014 85 with no AP). They determined the bumper must have been pushed in - it looked perfectly fine, but hairline cracks in the paint indicated a low speed impact (no surprise, I park on the street in Manhattan). This caused damage to the radar mount and stoped my AP. Insurance covered it, they made an estimate, Tesla did the work and told me on Friday afternoon that my car is ready to be picked up, minus the bumper refinishing which will be done later at a body shop. So far so good. Then I looked at the bill...

They charged double the insurance estimate for labor and tacked on a $58 car storage fee. I had directed insurance payment to Tesla and so I expected just my deductible to be charged. I called State Farm and they told me Tesla had asked them to redirect the insurance payment to me. I called Tesla and they told me they don't accept payment from insurnace and moreover it was up to the customer to cover any discrepancy between the insurance payment and the bill Tesla charges. I tried to explain to the SC person what a supplement is (when a shop tells the insurance that the cost is above the estimate and they negotiate a new estimate). They said they don't do that and we had a rather drawn out back and forth about that with me trying to explain that it's standard SOP for shops. Finally they told me they need the insurance to call them. I ended up on a 3-way call with an agent from State Farm and the person at the SC, and the agent explained to them that they need to request a supplement. After Tesla got off the call, the agent warned me that I should only pay Tesla the insurance payout that I've received plus my deductible. She said it is up to shops to recover the additional costs from the insurance company. 

What State Farm told me seems to follow NY auto insurance laws. If so, what the SC is doing seems very questionable (and some discussion with the agent about this seemed to imply that). I'd appreciate some feedback on this as I plan to pick up the car Monday morning and I want to make sure I'm handling this correctly.",,0,0,0,0

3691756,SolarCity Bailout Analysis,neroden,2019-05-25 16:23:00,"SolarCity started panel leasing in 2008. So based on what you've told me, the first cash flow flip away from the tax equity partners would have happened in 2015. Cash flow should now be pointing more towards SolarCity for the 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012 vintages. It should start being noticeable on the financial statements once the year-7 flip has happened for the 2013 vintages, I'd guess. 

Going from 15% to 20% may not be much; it's about a $12 million a year boost to cashflow overall, I'd say, from reviewing Solarcity's 2016 financial statements (though smeared out across the vintages). Going from 20% to 70% should be a boost of $168 million/year for the last couple of years of the contracts. I doubt they'll get many contract renewals, so I expect them to offer the homeowners the opportunity to buy their panels starting in 2023 (when the 15-year leases from 2008 run out). They'll probably have to offer prices a bit lower than new solar installs, and I think most people will take the opportunity. While that may not make them much money, it'll make them some money at that point.

I believe for the PPAs the inverter replacements were merely estimated (i.e. the inverters are warranted for 20 years, but only expected to last for 10); if the inverters happen to not fail, they can replace them later. For the leases, which have a production guarantee, I'm not sure; I would expect not, though. They have monitoring systems so they should be able to tell when they have an inverter failure (rather than waiting for the homeowner to call) and prioritize it. Inverter costs have come down somewhat in the years since initial install, though the service costs of showing up to replace the inverters remain significant. Even if they do preemptively replace them (which I doubt), the first inverter replacements should have happened last year, but significant numbers not until next year.",,0,0,0,0

My dad sold all of his TSLA stock this week. He holds about 100 stocks, so it was not a big deal for him, but still about $60k worth of TSLA that he probably lost about 30% on. He was not a high conviction investor, mostly influenced by me in deciding to buy the stock a couple of years ago. He lives in Seattle so he sees lots of Teslas all around. The FUD was ultimately too much for him along with the weakness of the stock. He is totally convinced that Tesla is doomed at this point. Too much debt, Elon's unstable and you can't trust him, and of course, demand looks like a problem already. I decided not to try to persuade him to keep his stock at this point. I feel a little guilty about it actually. He feels better just getting rid of a loser in his portfolio. I think he's right to jettison a stock that he has low conviction in. I'm sure he's got a lot of company selling TSLA on this huge drop. We've even seen a number of old timers here decide to sell and move on. It takes serious conviction to hold TSLA through all of this.
""

Well said. Reminds me of my uncle, who is a news fanatic (print and TV) and seems to have digested the same narrative despite being clever and sometimes wise on other topics.

One thing that comes to mind here — perhaps for the first time in these terms — is that there are not only early adopters, the mass market, and laggards in tech adoption, but also in investments related to that S-curve. We are clearly still in the early stages of the EV/Tesla adoption curve, so why should anyone really be surprised that we're in the early stages (presumably) of the TSLA adoption curve?

The Amazon chart I put here comes to mind again: 2013–2019: Tesla Sales Jump From ~20,000 Per Year To ~20,000–30,000 Per Month ... But Tesla Stock (TSLA) Barely Up | CleanTechnica

 

I totally understand that it's easy to get spooked with so much FUD. It effects practically everyone.

Though, referencing another comment of yours I agree with, I think some big institutions got tired of the game, concerned about the risk (SEC, Elon, shorters, etc.), and pocketed nice returns they collected in the past few years. Now we're back to 2013 levels, okay, but assuming Tesla continues to achieve its goals (as it has done for a decade), the money will come back, other money will come back, and there will be more opportunity to sell high (I presume, not advice).

The main point for today (or Monday) seems to me to be: good opportunity to buy low.",,0,0,0,0

Here is a follow up on my ""quality time"" with the browser.

Like most, I received 16.1.1 last Friday night, and 16.2 Wednesday night.

Long story short, the browser is again usable for me. Not perfect, still need some workaround now and then, but what a difference. 

- it's way faster in loading pages. Either on 3G or Wifi. With the sketchpad in background, it's arguably ""fast"".
- it's solid. It did not stall/block any more, and no reboot required at any time to unblock it. Each time a site would seem to fail (e.g. Waze often), entering some keyword in the address bar to trigger the Google search has worked every time so far to move away from the apparently crashed site.
- it is still capricious when it comes to sites needing GPS location. Sites needing location prompt the browser for user approval. Not always and even if it prompts and you grant it, it may still fail to load the site. So still some conditions creating issue when the location is required.
- it still benefits a lot from ""disabling"" the navigation, using the Sketch pad trick. So if I want to browse sites, I open first the sketchpad. If it is just to have Waze assisting my drive, no need for the sketchpad.

So excellent progress, as I can again use Waze, even on 1h drives with nav, it does not crash anymore.

That refers to ""immobilizers"" which prevent the ""operation of the engine"". Since Teslas don't have an engine, as far as I can tell, it doesn't apply.

(I have no idea how they're interpreting the rules currently but I'd guess it's something else -- not the ""immobilizer"" -- which is preventing conversion of US models to Canada. But note that the ""substantial modification"" phrasing is relevant to Model S and Model X, and for all we know Model 3 is identical between the US and Canada.)

I have a 2018 MS and I’m looking for a good sleeping solution for short naps and possible occasional “camping”. For reference I’m 6’3” 185lbs

Or




MINNESUND Foam mattress - firm, white - IKEA


Would love to hear from anyone that has either of these as ease of set up, amount of space used when not in use and ease of rolling back up?


My main question is what have people been doing to fill the gap behind the front seats in order to create a level surface for the mat? This is something I can’t figure out. Being 6’3” I would ideally like to maximize that space so I can stretch out.

3691817,Warranty repair,Dbscal,2019-05-25 17:01:00,"Hey all,

So based in LA and I want a second opinion on whether or not this is acceptable for a repair situation from a service centre. I have a late 2018 Model3 LR delivered in Dec 2018 with 6k+ miles. Everything was awesome with delivery and in my opinion perfect when I got my hands on the car. 

So beginning of April I experienced the dreaded crack in the rear pano roof, just above the trunk lid. Booked in a service appointment waited two weeks and took the car in. Everyone was super helpful and the managed to replace the glass in 24 hours. I was very impressed and pleased with the service. A few days after i started noticing a clicking sound coming from the rear of the car which was becoming annoying on journeys and was not apparent before the repair. I decided to book an appointment in the app and waited another 3 weeks for my appointment to come around. 

I took the car in that day and did a drive with the tech who immediately heard the issue. 24 hours later i got a call saying they think they repaired the noise and indicated it was coming from the central roof strut (spanning left to right of the car, inbetween the two glass roof sections) and that they replaced some clips and packed some sound deadening material in there. They told me that if it came up again dont worry about booking the car via the app and bring it straight in. It just so happens that I had to drive there the next day as the noise was still apparent and subsequently did another drive with the tech. 

That was two weeks ago now, they have given me a weekly call to let me know they were waiting for parts. What I am mostly concerned about is that they said they will have to send the vehicle to a body shop to repair it. From what i can gather they have ordered a new centre cross strut and it will need to be welded into position! Now, i have no idea where i stand on welding parts considering the car has never been in an accident and it is making me feel a little uneasy. I would appreciate some reassurance on allowing this to happen considering.

3691818,$235 TSLA - BUY BUY BUY,Silicon Desert,2019-05-25 17:01:00,"sunny-value said:
↑

I posted on here a week or so ago, trying to decide if I should get back in at all (close to IPO buyer lucky enough to have gotten out in the high 300s). You and a bunch of others have convinced me that I should look elsewhere with any money I hope to get back. Everyone who is bullish to really super bullish on here no longer sounds plausible to me. Its one think to sink 25,000$ into a thousand shares and hope for the best when a company is new (and do so with multiple newish companies) and quite another to decide to put 300k plus back into that name even after it has fallen 50%.
""

So I hope I am not convincing anyone to do one or the other with Tesla  I was just stating my recent short cover. Like anyone else I can be 50% right and 50% wrong. I just got lucky a few times on this stock and not willing to press my luck at this point to either buy again or short again. I'll wait while the money is at work elsewhere.

Frankly, my process is not to make decisions on selling a stock that I own based on where the price is now and where I ""GUESS"" it will go from here. The process that has worked for me at least 80% of the time is that as soon as I buy a stock, I immediately go in and put a trailing stop on it. The percentage of the trail depends on the volatility of the stock. Then I don't have to worry about it or watch it, else I would probably be wrong more often than right if I am making the decision to sell. Likewise, when I short a stock, I immediately go in and put a cover order at a percentage above the current price and a cover at a price below. That's my process and for 35 years, it has served me well. Everyone has their own technique of course.

Lastly, the part that bothers me right now is what ANALyst say. I never follow them or their advice, but know that other many other people do. My decisions are based on a lot of factors and data from fundamental and technical and general market direction. There are bears out there saying $10 which I think is ridiculous, and bulls saying $4,000 in 5 years which I also doubt.",,0,0,0,0

It does save him a lot of money and time to market, but it also comes with a risk of things costing to fix.

It did conclude that current NEM solar design departs from building a system that covers 95% of annual energy use now to 110%. You may be better off relying on the solar size they are providing you. Apparently I learn that SunWorks, my installer, uses their modeling software. Not sure how Tesla does their sizing. Ask what they are using in their model, or find another installer.

EV-A is changing. An expected plan phases in July 2019. Because you haven’t reach PTO on any solar or energy storage system (ESS), your EV-A rate schedule will shift to 4-9PM peak and 12AM-3PM off-peak. A solar or ESS will grandfather those in. This will vastly affect your projections. 

PG&E will always be revenue neutral with rate changes and time of use restructuring. The new EV rate plan is designed for ESS ONLY in my opinion. I stress that. All rate (E-1, ETOU-A, ETOU-B) plans according to PG&E rate comparison tool are exactly the same annual bill today. Current EV-A is half the cost. The rate change to the new EV rate schedule using my fancy spreadsheet brings the annual cost equal to all other rates. There’s no advantage for one rate plan over the other coming July.

I bought a fully optioned car for a large sum of money, referred several others (for which Tesla kindly comped me), and planned to buy the roadster.

Your plan seems fine. Unless you have a long commute, or extreme cold where you want lots of pre-warming of the vehicle, I think you’ll find that ~3.8kW of charging is fine most of the time. Looks like you are in a place where electricity is cheap most likely, so you don’t need to worry about fitting all your charging into a short overnight “cheap” window on a time-of -use plan. Just plug in whenever you are home!

Just check the wiring integrity of course - I would think that for a heater it would have to be pretty solid though.

I just brought Romex right into the back of mine with a standard screw-in clamp for the wire screwed into the Wall Connector. It was 6AWG, but I don’t think you will have any problem with the terminals with 12AWG. They are a robust clamping type and will work fine with a small wire. My terminals were fully clamped when I got my HPWC - and it is a little hard to tell whether they are fully clamped or fully unclamped, so if the tightening screws won’t turn clockwise, turn counterclockwise to fully loosen before inserting the wire! Took me a few minutes to figure that out...

The smaller wire will make it a lot easier to wire up! Obviously, select position 2 for the rotary setting.",,0,0,0,0

I disagree. I find @Doggydogworld ’s analogy useful.

A battery pack and a fuel tank provide the same basic purpose for the vehicle, namely a container for energy. It shows how extreme of a disadvantage EV’s labor under.

It is also true that it is easier for EV’s to compete with higher performance engines/transmissions as they can make up much of the ground they lose from having to replace a very cheap fuel tank with a very expensive battery pack, because high performance electric motors and single speed gearboxes aren’t much more expensive than lower performing ones.

It was part of the genius of Tesla to always attack segments with expensive engine/transmission combos vs. the rest of the industry who thought “Well batteries are expensive so let’s just not use many and we’ll also make the rest of the car super cheap to try and compensate for the cost of the batteries”.

The rest of the industry is still nowhere near making up this disadvantage even on higher cost vehicles. I suspect Tesla is “cheating” by finding cost savings throughout the vehicle rather than only in the motors and batteries.",,0,0,0,0

Still weighing up the range issue. I’m convinced that for the vast majority of trips we would have no issue - It’s just the ocassional extended road trip.

Look at any range issue in a percentage term, as of now an X75 would likely cover over 90% of your driving comfortably, for less than 10% of the time on longer inland trips a bit of careful driving and forward planning is needed, as each year passes more DC chargers are built increasing your percentage of comfortable driving from 90% to closer to 100%.

Solar is very possible, it's about creating solar body panels that are good enough- cost, weight, looks. Ideally the body panels would actually be cheaper than normal ones, weight can make a big difference.
Doesn't have to provide all the energy required for daily use but even that is not impossible and the requirements vary. Lots of people drive 5-10 miles per day but even 40 miles under ideal conditions can be doable with a sedan like M3.
At the end of the day, if you can make it a free lunch, even half a mile per day is better than nothing. It's all about making it a free lunch. In a way, it is a lot like the solar roof tiles, don't make the cost an additive or at least minimize it.

People tend to think about it the wrong way, it takes forever to fill the battery or that it needs to satisfy all customers or fully cover the energy needs of the vehicle.
It just needs to create sufficient value so the seller can earn a buck.

Btw, this must be an important update for Tesla as this is only the second time EVER (in 2.5 years of owning 2 Model S'es) that a firmware update got deployed to both cars on the same night. The last one was when they did the major increase to the autopilot nags. I wonder what was so urgent. Of course, it could be a coincidence, but still, only the seconds time ever.
""

To update, 16.2 might have fixed the traffic problem. I played around with it a little, and didn't as much difference in browser performance with traffic on/off. Browser still incredibly slow and locked up completely the next day (won't load anything, not even tesla.com or google.com) - a reboot might help but I stopped caring enough to do that.",,0,0,0,0

After a day thinking about it, here are my off-the-cuff expanded thoughts on Starlink.

I don't think people understand how important this SpaceX Starlink constellation is yet. Namely, we're living in the future now and even sooner than we think.

The 4B people (mostly developing countries) that aren't on the worldwide internet are going to have cheap access in 2-3 years because of this (or nearly instantaneously when it turns on). That's amazing - we're talking about revenues of increased to $30B-$50B for SpaceX in just a single day/week/month too (to further space exploration and colonizing the Moon and Mars). We're talking about a social media app like Facebook going from 2B users to 6B users, potentially, in a single day/week/month (obviously not accurate, but just explaining the potential situation). Other possibilities:


We'll be able to live anywhere, practically, with access to the Internet and all services.
Developing countries will suddenly have access to all apps, info, and data that's accessible to people in Silicon Valley in just one day, cheaply.
We'll be able to have all your devices, individually, connected to the Internet from practically anywhere.
Companies will be able to improve logistics and fleet routes to decrease, significantly, travel time for shipped goods.
Tons and tons of data collection across all devices (e.g. clean tech and electricity consumption and weather devices) at high throughput.
Lots of implications when you start really delving into what this constellation means, I think. Thoughts?

OK so this will be the third time I’ve fallen foul of a New York City pothole, the prior times just destroyed the tire, this time my front and rear wheels are both trashed. I can’t believe the tire didn’t blow out. This happened at about 25mph on Hamilton Ave in Brooklyn.

So I want to change to a 19” wheel and tires with a slightly higher wall. After this repair, I’ll have spent more in wheels and tires than I spent on gas, service and repairs on my prior car in 3 years, so I really need to change.

I have the performance brakes so looking for any advice compatible with the larger calipers and who’s qualified to do it on a Tesla. My SC already said they won’t fit 3rd party wheels.

Sorry to hear about your wheels issues. I'm dreading the same thing happening to me when I get my P3. I've bubbled a few side walls on my 5 series run flats on pot holes. 

Id look into Home page
They make a 18"" & 19"" wheel for the mustangs that fit over P brakes and are strong and light weight. If you search around the forums some people have got them. They said they have apex a call and they where helpful on getting you the right fitment. Some went with square set up. That's what I plan on doing. Your post makes me think about doing it sooner. 


Also Tsportline and unplugged performance has other wheel options that will fit in P brakes but they are heavier then the apex. But looks are different so you'll know what you like more. Good luck and keep us posted on what you do.",,0,0,0,0

I guess the problem with blaming the drivers in the floor mat cases is the NHTSA found that brake fade was a real issue when it comes to the high speed SUA events.

I'm an owner, a stock holder, and an admitted fanboy and I get excited when asked to talk about my car. In fact, it seems every time I turn around these days a friend or a friend of a friend is interested in buying a Tesla and wants my opinion and advice. Typically when these people speak to me they want to know what I think about my car and what I think about the company. They read a lot of negative things, most of which is FUD, and often I'm asked if I think Tesla will be around to service their car or if they will they go bankrupt. Some of this stuff is just silly of course but what they don't know to ask about are the real issues that occur in Tesla ownership.

As a regular reader and contributor to this forum I am often disappointed in reading how poorly Tesla sometimes behaves (and dare I say sometimes it seems Tesla is inept) in dealing with their customers. Things like lack of quality assurance, screwed up deliveries, delayed warranty work, spare parts availability, etc. that all get in the way of what could be a great experience. I'm willing to put up with all this but would others if they knew about it beforehand?

Listen, I'm a big fan of Tesla and I believe they have a bright future, but I also recognize it's not yet all sunshine and roses. Tesla still has lots of problems and we see that everyday on this forum. So the question is, how much of the stuff that is not so great about Tesla ownership should we share with potential or new Tesla owners?

Worthless urban supercharger?

People in North Dakota would take a few of those!

The sense of entitlement is truly stunning.
""

For someone who has no food, a carton full of Twinkies is a godsend. That doesn't mean that eating them for every meal won't kill you pretty quickly, nor that anybody who had a choice between a box full of Twinkies or a couple of small cheeseburgers would choose the box of Twinkies, despite it ostensibly being more food.

The purpose of urban superchargers is to make the charging network more generally useful by getting locals to charge there instead of at the V2 superchargers. The problem is, it isn't working very well at all in the Bay Area, from what I've seen. Every time I look at the supercharger map, the urban superchargers at Santana Row are mostly empty, and the normal V2 superchargers just a couple of miles away in Cupertino are ~100% full, as are the superchargers just a couple of miles from there in Sunnyvale. What this means is that, with the possible exception of a few hours in the evening, nobody is using these things.

An urban supercharger in Santa Cruz would be even more useless for most Tesla owners, because approximately 100% of people who live in Santa Cruz who own or can afford to own Teslas work in the Silicon Valley. That means approximately 100% of them work within a ten-minute drive of a real supercharger. And it also means that approximately 100% of them have a commute that is anywhere from 1–2 hours each way.

Because Santa Cruz is separated from the Bay Area by mountains, a round trip from Santa Cruz to, for example, Google, requires a whopping 110 miles of range. A round trip to Apple is only shorter by about 4–10 miles, depending on route and on whether you're in Apple Park or in and around the IL campus. In either case, to keep a sane cushion, you don't want to go below about 140–150 miles, or ~50% SOC. This makes that market very different from the South Bay. Santa Cruz Tesla drivers can't just charge once a week when they go out shopping. Rather, they typically need to supercharge their car either to 90% three times per week or to 50% five or six times per week.

So if you live in Santa Cruz and work in the Valley, your options are:

Charge to 90% 3x per week at an urban supercharger near your house (3 hours, 45 minutes total)

Charge to 50% 5x per week at an urban supercharger near your house (3 hours, 45 minutes total)

Charge to 90% 3x per week at a real supercharger near work (3 hours total)
Charge to 50% 5x per week at a real supercharger near work (2 hours, 30 minutes total)
Needless to say, I would not expect anyone to choose to spend half again longer just to charge closer to home. With that in mind, the only reason for putting an urban supercharger in Santa Cruz would be to have an emergency solution for Silicon Valley tourists who go down for the weekend, drive more than they planned, and run their batteries down. And they could serve that need just as easily with a CCS-to-Tesla adapter chained to the side of a few of the existing DC fast chargers in the area, for a lot less money. An urban supercharger certainly won't serve the needs of the locals very well at all, so they'll continue to charge over the hill at real superchargers if they can't charge at home.

With that in mind, if you're Tesla and you have a given number of dollars to spend on superchargers, do you put in one V2 supercharger that people will actually use or two urban chargers that people will ignore in favor of the real thing? If you're sane, you do the former. So I would argue that, at least in that region, an urban supercharger would be nearly worthless.

In fact, the Mountain View, Sunnyvale, and Cupertino superchargers all desperately need to be upgraded to V3 superchargers because they're so hopelessly short on capacity. When they do that, they'll have a giant pile of V2 supercharger equipment left over. Why not use that to add some limited V2 capacity in Los Gatos and Watsonville and to build out a full V2 supercharger in Santa Cruz?",,0,0,0,0

They mentioned the avoidance system in the launch broadcast.

When you have 12k satellites versus 34k objects (22k current objects plus 12k satellites), that is 408 million potential collisions at any point in time. If those 12k sats move, then the data needs recalculated.
Each satellite is self guided with a star tracker to allow it to steer the beams to their targets and to create the laser inter satellite links. To make these links, they also need to know where the closest satellites are. Thus they already have position data on 12k out of the 34k objects. Additionally, they do not need to check against objects that do not cross their orbit, increasing the Starlink to other object ratio. So the objects they need to be most aware of are other Starlink satellites.

In the (mangled) words of Pogo: we have met the object and he is us.

3691921,Market politics,wdolson,2019-05-25 17:53:00,"It isn't just Russia doing the manipulation. I heard on NPR yesterday about a study done on the EU elections and social media manipulation. He said tracking down who was behind all the extreme right social media traffic was difficult, but he was able to run most of it in Spain to two people operating independently. One was a pensioner living on one of Spain's outer islands and the other was a young kid also living in Spain.

The grassroots have taken a page from the Russians and run with it.

Modern technology has exposed a flaw in democracy. For those of us who grew up before the internet was a big thing, news outlets were limited. There were always fringe magazines and newspapers, but you had to seek them out. When I was at Boeing, there was a machinist's union strike and the American Socialist Party was distributing a newsprint flyer with their ""news"" and one circulated our office (I was on the engineering side and we weren't all that affected by the strike). I found it a fascinating bit of propaganda. The fact I knew the source and someone had to make the effort to print them up limited the scope of the impact this sort of literature could have.

Most of the news we were exposed to was produced by professional journalists who worked under a code of ethics. There was always spin on the news, but anybody running wild with a story and making things up would be caught and crucified by the rest of the news media, so the news stayed in a relatively narrow band. Because everything was vetted for accuracy, we believed that, at minimum, the broad strokes of the news were accurate. Details were often wrong, but the core story was correct.

The ways the news got things wrong was brought home to me when I was in high school and there was a high profile kidnapping in my home town. This being the Los Angeles media market, it was the lead story on all the news for weeks. My parents knew the girl's grandparents, so they got the details of the story directly from the family. The local news could never get the city right. 

There is something odd about Monterey Park, CA. It seems even Angelinos have no idea where it is, even though I grew up only 10 miles from Los Angeles city hall and 5 miles from Dodger Stadium. When we had the issues with Tieman I tried to calm things a bit when I noticed he had taught in literally the city next door and even he couldn't get the name of Monterey Park right, calling it Monterey Heights (which was old name of the town, changed in the 1920s).

Anyway, the local news got the core highlights right. She was a young girl who had been kidnapped from a prominent family. The news got where she was from wrong, her exact age, and some other details, but the overall story was correct.

When the first Gulf War happened, I watched the coverage on the CBC out of Vancouver, BC because I thought they gave a much more balanced coverage. The US coverage was always waving the flag, but they did get the core facts right.

During the 90s this began to change. People without training in how to distinguish a factual story from opinion, most will get them confused. This is especially true for those who don't have an advanced education. The new conservative media empires took advantage of this and package opinion as news. First with talk radio programs like Rush Limbaugh, and then with Fox News.

They were able to mold public opinion among those who would listen to them, but critically they also got those who wouldn't believe their stuff to distrust all news sources. The political world became a zone where fact and opinion became muddied and conservative talking points controlled the narratives in politics.

This fracturing of the norms was done with discipline by right wing media. Rodger Ailes had meetings every morning where he drilled that day's talking points into the heads of every on air personality. It was all done to help Republicans win.

But the fractures continued and the news media became very balkanized. With the internet, the bar for getting into the news business was lowered dramatically. It opened the door for some serious, good journalism like fivethirtyeight.com but it also opened the door for any extremist with a little bit of skill with video editing to create some pretty serious looking work that was factually BS. For example one video making the rounds in the EU elections put up by extremist right wing anti-immigrant types show a group of angry immigrants tearing apart a police car in a riot. It's a clip from an old movie. It never happened.

The Russians have also been able to weaponize this to their advantage, setting up a center in St Petersburg to chum the waters and destabilize democracies.

The upside in all this is the Millennials seem to be more immune to this type of reality manipulation than older generations. They grew up in this swamp and probably got burned with online reality manipulation in jr high when they could check the reality with their peers. That sort of fact checking can be done when the warping is about someone you know in real life. It's impossible to do with someone you never met thousands of miles away, but people who have been burned tend to learn that the online world can be manipulated and tend to be less willing to accept anything at face value.

To those who grew up in a world where all the news they saw had some vetting, and anything they knew about people they had met was usually through real person contact, getting sucked into a vortex of lies is easier. Especially people who have locked themselves into a self imposed ghetto of news from a limited number of sources. These days you can get multiple outlets telling the same, false story. There are almost always other outlets explaining how the story is false and why, but you need to seek those sources out.

Out time is a crossroads. The younger generations are less likely to believe in this reality manipulation that's going on, but they aren't in power and don't have much interest in it yet. Though the failures of the Boomers and Gen Xers in this realm have encouraged some to jump into the political arena at a younger age than they might have done otherwise. 

The facts remain that the bulk of voters are currently GenX and Boomers and they are more manipulated by thee reality games. Whether democracy is going to fail or not before the population wakes up to how badly reality is being manipulated is the choice point of our time. It's playing out in the US, but also in many parts of Europe too.

Established democracies have a lot of institutions that are helping stem the tide, but they are being pushed to the brink.",,0,0,0,0

We readers of this forum are not your typical Tesla owner. I know numerous other Tesla owners and they are clueless as to the in’s and outs of charging. They have the car set to a specific charging level of 80 or 90% (based on my explaining to them it is not good for the battery to be constantly charged to 100% and then left to sit (they don’t understand why it would be a problem) and never touch it again. It also amazes me that whenever I supercharge and talk to other owners there, that they have no idea about the sharing of a charger between 2 stalls

Further, one can not rely upon the Tesla app. It does not reliably report the charging status nor does it always allow me to remotely change the charge limit via the Tesla app or the Tesla Remite app (which may be due to cellular signal strength issues at certain supercharging sites).

As an aside, you can’t even rely on the information provided on the center screen regarding the number of stalls in use.

The absolutely best way to get the numbers is just take some trips to the car.

If you take some trips, then you may find that it really isn't that big of a deal. If you drive 75 or more, you aren't going to make your numbers. If you slow down, you'll get your range. It's a lot easier than everyone wants to make it.

As soon as you stop worrying about how big the battery exactly is and how much degradation it doesn't have, then you can start enjoying the car.
Driving from Cape Canaveral to above Atlanta, two stops. Because of time, we couldn't eat at the location that we wanted to and had to wait a little while charging at the second stop. 10 hour drive, about 525 miles. In a LR RWD Model 3.
I pretty much drove it as an ICE.
And actually drove down the day before. It was a quick trip to see a SpaceX launch, planned at the last minute and at least the third trip the car had made down there. Oh and last weekend, made basically the same length trip to Dayton/Xenia Ohio. 2,000 miles in 10 days, at least 1900 on FSD.

Everyone is different. For me, and for some others, I want to know how many Wh/rmi there are. It helps me easily understand how many miles I am likely to get.

v16.2 supposedly has the fix for the live traffic being a CPU load hog, I wonder now if they've pushed it out to update every 2 minutes as it should have been instead of many times per second that just happens to coincide with Spotify stuttering? Could be worth turning off live traffic and seeing if it goes away.

This was when driving today with live traffic turned off. Very annoying indeed.

They did do something good with this release though, because MCU1 feels overall more responsive. And the live traffic CPU bug is fixed.",,0,0,0,0

He just did a random lookup on cars in order and found that mine is ready... :-|
I told him that rumors has it that there is a production bottleneck with the new powertrain cars, he said that yes there is a bottleneck but those are for the standard range (which does not make sense to me at all). He re-assured me that mine is with the new powertrain. I wish there is a way to verify it independently? VIN decoding or something?

The DLRs are LED, separate from the fog lights. Fog lights should not be confused with driving lights (extra bright lights some cars used to have). The problem is not the fog lights, but that you can't legally run fog lights in most places without having the headlights on, so they are ineffective in fog. (The reason fog lights work in fog if only fog lights are on is because they are mounted low so the light isn't reflected back by the fog. Turning the headlights on defeats the fog lights because the light is just reflected back.

The moose test is a simple matter of the torque applied by the lateral acceleration being opposed by torque caused by the tire grip.

3691988,2015 Tesla Accelerated into a wall,TKGA,2019-05-25 18:35:00,"I experienced an unexpected acceleration in a test drive today. Here is what happened:

1. I had just used autopilot (auto steer) before in the highway.
2. I took off autopilot at the exit and slowed down for the stoplight. 
3. As soon as the light turned green I lightly stepped on the gas. It started to move slowly. 
4. It then unexpectedly accelerated into the turn without me changing foot pressure. 

At first I was concerned. Now here is what we believe happened: 

1. I turned autopilot / auto steer off by steering. 
2. But traffic aware adaptive cruise control (TACC) was still on as evidenced by the speed limit sign encircled in blue. 
3. Because TACC was still on, I assumed I was braking the car at the light but it was TACC. 
4. Light turned green, I started to go through, and TACC started to automatically accelerate me to the previous cruise control speed limit. 

I’m new to TACC and especially an adaptive cruise control that brakes to 0mph without me touching the pedal. So I was not expecting the car to accelerate on its own.

Basically your argument boils down to quantum finance: ""you can exceed the speed of light as long as you do it quickly, and nobody sees you doing it.""

If me and a cohort have $7 Trillion backing us, we can sell as many shares as we want, as fast as we want, driving the price down to whatever we want, regardless of whether any actual owners of the stock sell a single share.

When Porsche was testing the Taycan, their test cars were spotted in snowy and freezing mountains, blistering hot desert, urban environments, etc. Model 3's first encounter with snow was by customers encountering frozen doors, chargers, windows, etc. Even driving in the rain was apparently new to Model 3, as some bumpers fell off in heavy rain, and nobody at Tesla realized that changing wiper speeds though multiple menu levels on the touch screen was not a great idea (AFAIK they fixed it by forcing the correct final menu screen up whenever you turn on the wiper stalk) - I guess it doesn't rain much in California. So, both software and hardware at Tesla follows the agile methodology. The problem with hardware is that fixes cost money to deploy per customer.

They make a 18"" & 19"" wheel for the mustangs that fit over P brakes and are strong and light weight. If you search around the forums some people have got them. They said they have apex a call and they where helpful on getting you the right fitment. Some went with square set up. That's what I plan on doing. Your post makes me think about doing it sooner.
Also Tsportline and unplugged performance has other wheel options that will fit in P brakes but they are heavier then the apex. But looks are different so you'll know what you like more. Good luck and keep us posted on what you do.

I currently own a P100DL and a P85D and I disagree with your assessment. If you’ll not go to the track to get it actually timed them buy Dragy.

Dragy is one of the most accurate performance testers I’ve ever used. Dragy gives 60ft and 0-30 as well as every other form or acceleration measurements. 

Here’s my experience with the two cars:
While my P85D is no slouch running 11.85 1/4 mile on Insane (not plus), with only 77% state of charge. The P100DL runs a full second faster at an even at an even lesser state of charge. No matter how hard your P85D launches a P100DL with no issues should end up wining the 1/4 mile by 8-10 car lengths (for a non ludicrous P85D).

I saw numerous posts where ""used"" Teslas owners (the buyer being the 2nd owner to that used car) were not eligible for the Ludi upgrade. The bottomline is that even if the performance model one will buy is new, because he bought the used tesla in the first place, he is ineligible (according to posts I have read).

Heck I even saw one new 75D owner(I think it was Elektrek comments) was not eligible for Free Ludi even he buys 2nd Model S Performance because one sales rep said it was not ""new PERFORMANCE model."" For that, I think the sales rep is wrong.

As others mentioned, Tesla isn't able to retrofit AP hardware onto older cars that don't have it to start with.

Tesla did build some cars after mid-September of 2014 which had Autopilot hardware that was not activated. (You had to upgrade from the Tech package to ""Tech package with Autopilot,"" and it's possible some owners never did that.) If that was the case, you would still see ""convenience"" features like lane departure warning.

For a definitive answer, you need to look at the lower front grille of the Model S. If it has AP1 hardware, there will be a rectangular radar sensor right in the center (see picture.) If that's present, then the car can support Autopilot. If it's missing, then you're out of luck.",,0,0,0,0
3692066,Destroyed Wheel bun Pothole. Need Advice,SMAlset,2019-05-25 19:29:00,Very nasty. Don't know about your area of the country but we won our claim against a city on the Peninsula here a number of years ago when at night a huge pothole that was covered up by heavy rain took out our two right side passenger tires and one or two wheels. The city told us they never pay out on that kind of thing but the shop keeper who was located near that area had told us that she had seen a handful of cars that had gotten flats right at that spot and it had been going on all day even before the rain. In fact the car in front of us hit it too blowing out a tire and we both waited in the rain for a tow. The shop keeper was sure it had been reported to the city as a dangerous pothole prior and based on that we found out it had in fact and that the city hadn't taken any action to mark off the area or have a crew out to fill it. They paid out. The tires were prorated for time in service but getting hit with two tires and one or two wheels at the same time to replace was still a huge help. Good luck.,,0,0,0,0

It's absolutely paramount for market participants to be transparent in my opinion. Nontransparent entities are high risk because you essentially invest into them based on just faith (which is absolutely the case with Tesla, BTW). This is why security regulations exist, but they were created long time ago when it was hard to disseminate information. It's much easier nowadays so companies should look into being more transparent than regulations require, not less.

""

I use the tape measure to measure the body panel gaps, mainly to make sure that they are roughly even on both sides. If they are off by 2 or 3 mm I’m not concerned but in one case the left side was 6mm wider than the same gap on the right side. One person holds the tape measure while the second person takes a photo on the Iphone. The photo can then be enlarged on the screen to easily identify the gap down to a single millimeter. Sometimes the door trim doesn’t align properly and it makes the doors look out of alignment when it’s just the trim. If so the service center can adjust the trim to make it look more even with just a few minutes of effort.

The flash light is mainly to inspect the cabin and underneath the car. Costa Mesa deliveries are indoors in a well lit area so swirl marks are fairly easy to spot, but there’s nothing I can do about them. I just assume if it’s a black car it’s going to need paint correction because they buff the car so aggressively that they create swirl marks all over the place. Ideally I’d prefer if they just washed the car and air dried it, but they put a thick coat of wax on the car to hide many of the imperfections and make the car look super shiny.",,0,0,0,0

I'm still waiting on my AWD Model 3 and HPWC to arrive. In the meantime I'm thinking of ways to install the HPWC.

My house entrance has a 240V fan/heater in the wall that we never use. The heater backs onto the garage wall, and is on a dedicated 20A breaker wired with 12/2 Romex. I could easily remove the heater and punch the wire through a hole into the garage.

My service is 125A, so I do plan on getting an electrician to replace my meter box, breaker panel, and possibly the wires to the pole out front if necessary for a 200A upgrade and a sub panel in the garage with 60A to the HPWC at some point.

This seems wildly inaccurate. They're no longer in the top 10 by market share.

Was driving capacity growth. Up until the absorption into TSLA, SCTY was rolling at about 35% marketshare and handling about half the regulatory battle effort and costs. The southwest US would look mighty different right now if it weren't for SCTY forcing their way into markets.

After SCTY acquisition Elon made the obvious decision to end door-to-door sales and just sit on his hands until better options came along. Sunrun and Vivint were more than happy to carry on the old SCTY sales model so no need for Elon to do so. Both those entities are still of course losing tons of money as they gain share and surpassed SCTY/TSLA. Costs for both are in the $3.50+/W range. Not price mind you....just the cost to them.

Tesla has now quietly moved into online sales priced with less than half the sales cost of their competitors and more importantly no annoying salesman in your living room(or the boardroom). Sunrun has threatened to match with an online product of their own, but I doubt their organization has the political will to do so. These are simply massive sales orgs that happen to be selling solar, sales runs everything and will never give up their cash cow business model. Tesla will be back on top by end of next summer(profitably this time), just as Powerwalls get a little cheaper and more mainstream.

My hope is that the competition is slow to adapt and we can acquire Sunrun on the cheap in a couple years. Vivint will fade to bankruptcy, Tesla will own 20-30% of straight solar sales and 60+% of leasing. I think that's a pretty good sustainable mix for the next decade.",,0,0,0,0

3692126,Papafox's Daily TSLA Trading Charts,Papafox,2019-05-25 20:09:00,"There certainly was a big difference towards TSLA in the views of small investors vs. big on Friday. TSLA traded between 202 and 200 in pre-market trading, but once the market opened the big dogs drove TSLA down and kept it down for the remainder of the day. There was enough interest in TSLA to defeat the first small MMD, but when the trading increased, the big dogs pushed her down about the time the NASDAQ took a dip (10:20ish). The NASDAQ recovered some lost ground after 11am, but TSLA did not. TSLA's inability to climb on a green macro day suggests the stock may dip lower before finally rebounding.



The NASDAQ opened very green but closed up only 0.11%

Several forces were in effect on Friday
* The momentum was upward from Thursday's trading, thus the pre-market strength
* The Friday before a three-day weekend is often a time for the big investors who typically back TSLA to leave for their weekends early, thus giving the bears lower volume and a better environment for manipulating the stock
* If you look at the Open Interest chart below, you'll see that market makers would want to prevent TSLA from running above 200 or below 190 at close, simply to maximize their profits. I suspect they influenced the stock price, at least in the final hour. Interestingly, that would be to keep TSLA above 190 through close, which happened, and then the stock dipped lower in after-market trading
* TSLA battled an unusually high quantity and quality of FUD this week, which unnerved many investors even though the leaked Musk email clearly showed the FUD was inaccurate. More on this topic below...



Friday's Open interest chart showed that market makers had a strong incentive to see TSLA close below 200 and a fairly strong incentive to see it close above 190. 

Regarding this week's FUD, the most damaging came from Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas. On April 8, he dropped his TSLA price target from $260 to $240. Such a small move makes you wonder if he just wanted to put out some bad news about Tesla. Then on April 30, he dropped the price target again, this time from $240 to $230. On May 19, TMC's @Navin speculated that with the FUD flying this heavily it was now time for either Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley to announce a downgrade. Sure enough, two days later on May 21, Jonas kept his price target intact but dropped his worst case scenario price to $10. This latest move caused even Tesla foe Cramer to call the price ridiculous. ARKInvest's Cathie Wood tweeted first that Jonas needs to compare notes with her because it is ICE vehicles, not EVs that are losing sales right now. Wood then teased that if Jonas kept his price target intact but dropped his worst case price, that must mean that either the probability of the best case scenario has increased or the worst case scenario decreased.

Jonas was apparently not amused and the following day put together a private call to advise investors of Tesla's critical situation. A copy of the PDF transcript can be found here. The event itself came across as weak as only two non-Morgan Stanley questions came in and Jonas's logic was sketchy at best. For example, he cited no vehicles on the Tesla horizon that could turn Tesla around with its lagging Model 3 sales and claimed there was very little interest in Model Y. (What about the Semi, too?) He painted a bleak picture of growth going away and Tesla losing money. If you read the transcript you will likely agree this was a hit job and not a work of careful analysis. 

The damage that Jonas did, however, was to throw that $10 number out there, and every click reporter in the country jumped on the story as a juicy new proof that the mighty Tesla had fallen. These stories did indeed induce some selling from within the community of longs. Then Citi Research, seeing how successful Jonas's ploy was, produced its own $36 worst case scenario number and the click reporters jumped on this story as well. What transpired was a potent new form of FUD that could be delivered by a willing analyst and I think this type of FUD greatly hurt TSLA last week.

The following day, Thursday, an email leak of Elon Musk's to employees showed what was actually going on at Tesla, which was heavy production and heavy deliveries (possibly surpassing Q4's delivery numbers). On a down day for the macros, Tesla gained a few dollars.

Which brings us to Friday. Now that the real story of Tesla's solid second quarter performance so far has been revealed, many of the click reporters dismissed the Musk email because it wasn't as newsworthy as Jonas's steaming pile of horsesugar, and went with the negative story. For example, in this AP release, the story closes with a quote from Senior Analyst Jessica Caldwell of Edmunds saying, ""There doesn't appear to be anything in the (product) pipeline that is going to save them,"" she said. ""Now Tesla seems to be losing the confidence of its biggest cheerleader, Wall Street.""

And we wondered why Tesla was having such a bad week. Look no further than journalists who receive the real story direct from the CEO's email and printed the horsesugar instead. 



The lower bollinger band is still heavily slanted downhill, so it is of no help in supporting the stock price. What Tesla needs right now is a major buyer who understands that the Tesla story is still very much intact and chooses to start picking up shares at these bargain prices. If not, we get to test the various expressions of support at 181, 180, or 177.50. 

For the week, TSLA closed at 190.63, down 20.40 from last Friday's 211.03. Hopefully, this stock will rebound well before Tesla's Annual meeting on June 11. If not, enough can be said about the present state of Tesla in the meeting to effect the turnaround, provided Tesla is still on track to meet Q2 guidance. In the meantime, get outside and shake off the stress of this irrational market behavior. This too will come to an end. Have a good weekend.

Conditions:
* Dow up 95 (0.37%)
* NASDAQ up 9 (0.11%)

No problem using the original fastener, but I had to use a hammer to provide some leverage to pop the plastic rivet-type fastener.

As I mentioned earlier, I put the one fastener in and secured it while the guard was hanging down.

The DLRs are LED, separate from the fog lights. Fog lights should not be confused with driving lights (extra bright lights some cars used to have). The problem is not the fog lights, but that you can't legally run fog lights in most places without having the headlights on, so they are ineffective in fog. (The reason fog lights work in fog if only fog lights are on is because they are mounted low so the light isn't reflected back by the fog. Turning the headlights on defeats the fog lights because the light is just reflected back. The distance that can be seen with just fog lights is much longer than the distance with headlights.)

White On White Unicorn FSD delivered today !
393xxx vin and 5/19 build

The Good:
No mechanical complaints, paint, what I could see looked ok.
White is harder to inspected than darker colors showing white defects.
The late afternoon sun showed the dirty rag glass windshield
swirls from amateur detailing.
Couple of smudges on white door panels, a baby wipe made quick work of that.

The Bad:
Was delivered with 2019.7.206 software, already experienced
dreaded screen flicker corruption and reboot.
When that first happened it corrupted my usb drive for music and dash cam 

Car was charging on my adapter but when placed back in the car they kept the Nema 14-50 adapter. Was told it’s no longer included. No amount Of arguing would suffice.
I was charged $15 dollars to get one to take home
No Phone cables but the J1772 adapter was furnished.

The Ugly
Delivery specialist was professional.
Somewhat rushed. Strange because there were no delivery’s after mine.
And with a number of my questions, let’s say, Misinformed.
As an example I Was told 7.206 software was the very latest.
No sentry mode.

Car is wonderful, and would do it again

More fodder to consider...

You gotta decide if your definition of feature complete matches others. In my book feature complete is simply that someone has coded a version of a feature from the original specification or from the story list. Doesn't mean it has to work. Doesn't mean the code ever gets exercised. It's just a little better than a stub. So one could say feature complete by the end of this year is very much possible. But it's not shipable and therefore not usable by anyone but in a controlled experiment.
""

No - it needs to be unit tested and generally working.

If they are doing some kind of agile development, the user story should have acceptance criteria in the form of test cases and the code should pass those cases.

Then the code gets released and they find all the edge cases it doesn't work under and fix those (""march of 9s"").",,0,0,0,0

Update:

I got my MX on 23rd May. I got a call the evening before from the delivery centre the night before asking if it was still ok to deliver at the tentative delivery time. This was after I had spoken 3 times to the Nevada centre that day and all of them told me it would be delayed. Up until the minute that it was delivered to our house my Tesla page said drafting contract. I never received any email/phone call from a delivery advisor, nor did I get any update emails.

Process was far from ideal but happy to have the car and it's great so far.

My advice for anyone else in the same position is to call the local service centre. Those guys were far more helpful and knowledgable than you get through the main number which puts you through to Nevada.

For me it would be a no-brainer to spend $1,500 more to get the Raven version. Increased resell value alone should make up for that unless you are going to keep it for a long time.

Well isn’t that what your supposed to do when presented with a yellow light....yield. How is the system supposed to know that there is “plenty of time before” the light turns red as there is no set time between yellow and red lights. Sometimes there is plenty and sometimes it’s ridiculously short depending on the particular intersection. I find that most people seem to just take the yellow light as an excuse to floor it, risking running a red light. In some states it is illegal to speed up through an intersection to avoid a red light. Don’t see Tesla programming the car to do this as running a red light would eventually happen. I guess people expect their autonomous car to drive with the same lack of concern for others as they do.

30,000 a week??? Fremont has yet to achieve 30,000 a month. I think these over optimistic pie in the sky numbers are just as damaging as the bear arguments. By all indications the factory in China is smaller than in Fremont AND they need to fit in battery and motor production.

That claim is from this S/A article published on Feb 14, 2019:

""The new Chinese Gigafactory will be built in “modules” of approximately 10% each, with the first module accommodating the mentioned 3,000/week production rate. Or put in another way, the Gigafactory 3 will eventually accommodate production of approx. 1.5 million vehicles a year (30,000 a week)""​

Right. Now check out this shot of the new VW I just got for a bit under half the money I paid for the Model 3. Them idiots even painted the underside!!!

View attachment 412057



As soon as they make a Model 3 that looks like that, drives like that and is that quiet (despite having a combustion engine), I’ll buy again!

I really don't get this perception that Teslas are of anything but dreadful quality. I get that they have some very likable and, in a few cases, outright intoxicating traits. Quality is however not one of them. It’s something that we choose to ignore, unless we really don’t know better.
""

Umm, the underside of my Tesla's hood is painted. Did they really not paint yours?

For looks, I'll take any Tesla over any VW in a heartbeat. Not that VWs look bad, but none of them look particularly good; they're appliances. Whether you like them or not, at least Teslas have a distinctive style. No VW comes close to the way a Model 3 dual motor drives; the Tesla totally kicks butt in that regard. As for quiet, my Tesla is quieter than any VW I've been in at city speeds and comparable on the highway.

My Tesla has not had ""dreadful quality"". Overall, I'd say the quality is comparable to, or better than, most new cars that I've bought in the last 20 years. Tesla generally uses high quality parts in their cars unlike some other cars out there. The problem has been that the quality of assembly has been rather uneven. I know that some people have had many issues with their cars, but for others, such as myself, the issues have been minimal. Still, this unevenness of construction quality is something Tesla needs to continue working on.",,0,0,0,0

3692215,Estimating battery capacity based on Supercharging readout,darth_vad3r,2019-05-25 21:15:00,"ewoodrick said:
↑

The absolutely best way to get the numbers is just take some trips to the car.

If you take some trips, then you may find that it really isn't that big of a deal. If you drive 75 or more, you aren't going to make your numbers. If you slow down, you'll get your range. It's a lot easier than everyone wants to make it.

As soon as you stop worrying about how big the battery exactly is and how much degradation it doesn't have, then you can start enjoying the car.
Driving from Cape Canaveral to above Atlanta, two stops. Because of time, we couldn't eat at the location that we wanted to and had to wait a little while charging at the second stop. 10 hour drive, about 525 miles. In a LR RWD Model 3.
I pretty much drove it as an ICE.
And actually drove down the day before. It was a quick trip to see a SpaceX launch, planned at the last minute and at least the third trip the car had made down there. Oh and last weekend, made basically the same length trip to Dayton/Xenia Ohio. 2,000 miles in 10 days, at least 1900 on FSD.

The car works, you just need to put the Excel sheets down and drive it!!!

Mine cracked at 8 months as well. They said they needed to inspect it. I explained it via text message it was inside layer and sent pictures. They agreed it shouldn’t be a problem.

Keep in mind we are seeing some huge sell orders to drop the stock or limit climbs.

No doubt it is bad.I haven't sold any of the calls I've picked up along this long drop. I was dumb enough not to sell at least a few when we bounced to $258 on the capital raise because the reversal back down happened so fast.

Basically your argument boils down to quantum finance: ""you can exceed the speed of light as long as you do it quickly, and nobody sees you doing it.""

If me and a cohort have $7 Trillion backing us, we can sell as many shares as we want, as fast as we want, driving the price down to whatever we want, regardless of whether any actual owners of the stock sell a single share.

I love it. See my profile picture for the bed fully deployed inside my Model S 75D. This is hands down the smartest money I have spent on an aftermarket item for a car. I've slept in it more times than I can count (solo and with my girl), and I've had the car less than a year. I am 6'3"" and I have room to spare... and when you pair this bed with the Dashboard for Tesla mobile app which has camper mode, you have a climate controlled hotel on wheels. High quality, sets up in less than 10 minutes, and equally easy to fold up and put away, or to strip down, wash the sheets/quilt and pack it up to be ready for your next trip. You can also leave it 75% deployed, just folding up the front 1/4 section while you drive, so you can pop it out in seconds if you want a quick nap while charging on a road trip. The memory foam mattress is as comfortable as the (very nice) Sealy in my master bedroom. Seriously... a genius product, and just so cool. Need I even add... that the panoramic roof takes on a whole new meaning when you sleep in this thing.

I configured it to match my car (black & grey to match my midnight silver w/ black interior). I love that they branded it to look like Tesla, including the ""DR≡AM"" lettering on the case... and they have a configurator online, just like when you ordered your car.

If you buy this, definitely spend the extra ~80 bucks for the custom sheets. So worth it! When I'm at a charging station, a campsite, a music festival, etc and I pop the hatchback... people flip out when they see this, just like they do if it's the first time they've seen a Tesla. I've literally seen jaws drop and people speechless, just staring into my car. They actually think it's ""something else"" that a Tesla can do!! lol. More than once I've had to explain that it does not come with the car.

The case does not have a carrying handle, and I can honestly say that is the only con, although I would hardly consider it that. I emailed them, and below is their response. They make a fine point, and after putting this product through its paces, I can tell you that it's not really a big deal because you are never going to carry it more than a couple feet:

Hi Jeremy,
We were pumped to hear you camped in comfort ! The lack of handle is valid point, we omitted it because it was hard to find something pretty and fuss-less that kept the clean design lines. With the Model X and 3 soft shell versions we had more options to sew in a handle and did - yes handling is better  We’re looking into a Model X handle, likely it will be fused in between case and fabric.


The company is great too (I do not work for them, lol)... they were friendly, responsive and a pleasure to deal with via email. No-brainer, I would recommend this to anybody!! Now, if they only had a referral program

I’d be pissed too... maybe leave a note or park in front and wait for the owner... but deflating the tires would be quite counter-Intuitive

If we’re irritated at him being parked there, why would we make it harder for him to leave?

White On White Unicorn FSD delivered today !
393xxx vin and 5/19 build

The Good:
No mechanical complaints, paint, what I could see looked ok.
White is harder to inspected than darker colors showing white defects.
The late afternoon sun showed the dirty rag glass windshield
swirls from amateur detailing.
Couple of smudges on white door panels, a baby wipe made quick work of that.

The Bad:
Was delivered with 2019.7.206 software, already experienced
dreaded screen flicker corruption and reboot.
When that first happened it corrupted my usb drive for music and dash cam 

Car was charging on my adapter but when placed back in the car they kept the Nema 14-50 adapter. Was told it’s no longer included. No amount Of arguing would suffice.
I was charged $15 dollars to get one to take home
No Phone cables but the J1772 adapter was furnished.

The Ugly
Delivery specialist was professional.
Somewhat rushed. Strange because there were no delivery’s after mine.
And with a number of my questions, let’s say, Misinformed.
As an example I Was told 7.206 software was the very latest.
No sentry mode.

Car is wonderful, and would do it again

Een paar weken zat ik dus op de A15 te spelen met een Model 3 Performance aan, die het er alleszins redelijk vanaf bracht. Totdat hij bijna achterop een auto knalde die plotseling ging inhalen. De bestuurster had niet gerekend op een Tesla die met 170 km/u komt aanzetten. Het liep net goed af.

Ik zag het voor me gebeuren en besloot op dat moment: hier houden we dus nu meteen mee op. Het is volstrekt onbelangrijk wie het snelst is en je moet er niet aan denken dat er mensen gewond raken of erger. Niets is dat waard.

↑

A solar design white paper was published Aurora Solar. It did conclude that current NEM solar design departs from building a system that covers 95% of annual energy use now to 110%. You may be better off relying on the solar size they are providing you. Apparently I learn that SunWorks, my installer, uses their modeling software. Not sure how Tesla does their sizing. Ask what they are using in their model, or find another installer.

EV-A is changing. An expected plan phases in July 2019. Because you haven’t reach PTO on any solar or energy storage system (ESS), your EV-A rate schedule will shift to 4-9PM peak and 12AM-3PM off-peak. A solar or ESS will grandfather those in. This will vastly affect your projections.

PG&E will always be revenue neutral with rate changes and time of use restructuring. The new EV rate plan is designed for ESS ONLY in my opinion. I stress that. All rate (E-1, ETOU-A, ETOU-B) plans according to PG&E rate comparison tool are exactly the same annual bill today. Current EV-A is half the cost. The rate change to the new EV rate schedule using my fancy spreadsheet brings the annual cost equal to all other rates. There’s no advantage for one rate plan over the other coming July. With this in mind, I feel rate arbitrage with solar alone is a lost cause.

The white paper pointed out maximum production and south facing was appropriate for past NEM policies. Today, it’s maximizing afternoon production.
""

Do you have a reference for where it says that only solar and ESS will be grandfathered. In all other cases I can recall, anyone on a rate plan that was closed was allowed to stay on during the grandfather period. It would be strange to force the change on EV owners without solar. It may be to their benefit if they have no solar or battery, but discriminating against a particular group of customers would be unusual.",,0,0,0,0

This article reminds me of the shocking article written by a roboticist 2 years ago:

Tesla Autopilot Review: Bikers will die

It's shocking because the scholar didn't disclose that Autopilot has been beta and the scholar was clueless of many of its limitations including its inability to avoid hitting cyclists.

Similarly, Consumer Reports should have informed potential buyers that they get what they pay for: a beta product that acts like an unfinished product so be a good sitter to the system if they wanted to pay for that.

Your plan seems fine. Unless you have a long commute, or extreme cold where you want lots of pre-warming of the vehicle, I think you’ll find that ~3.8kW of charging is fine most of the time. Looks like you are in a place where electricity is cheap most likely, so you don’t need to worry about fitting all your charging into a short overnight “cheap” window on a time-of -use plan. Just plug in whenever you are home!

Just check the wiring integrity of course - I would think that for a heater it would have to be pretty solid though.

I just brought Romex right into the back of mine with a standard screw-in clamp for the wire screwed into the Wall Connector (I know this is not the clamp you were talking about). It was 6AWG, but I don’t think you will have any problem with the terminals with 12AWG. They are a robust clamping type and will work fine with a small wire. My terminals were fully clamped when I got my HPWC - and it is a little hard to tell whether they are fully clamped or fully unclamped, so if the tightening screws won’t turn clockwise, turn counterclockwise to fully loosen before inserting the wire! Took me a few minutes to figure that out...

The smaller wire will make it a lot easier to wire up! Obviously, select position 2 for the rotary setting.

Electricity is much cheaper here. Premium gas in our BMW runs $110-120, and my GTI is $80+ per tank at around $1.70/litre or $6.40/gallon. Some months we easily spend $500 on gas.

Lol, no, that can be easily done in software. The car knows where it is via its GPS. It's just a setting flag in the configuration. And its trivial to show that Canadian cars have the same version of the software as US cars via the info screen.

The language option is also user configurable, it doesn't require any different software, its just a data file.

Already in the EU, certainly Autopilot features are disabled when you drive across certain borders where national policies differ. Drive back across the border, working again. This was discussed here on TMC a few months back, I think its 'auto lane-change without confirmation', but EU members may be able to confirm.

There is no VIN online and it still shows the RN. I called to double check that this is indeed the long range (370 miles) and matched my RN with theirs. The confirmed both :-O

I'm trying to find out what is my VIN and asked to take a delivery in a couple of days.. did anyone experience something like that?

Sounds like the same situation they had with old Model 3 reservations. Their database is so f***** up people with older reservations were just getting ignored.while new orders kept getting matched to cars.",,0,0,0,0

@Intl Professor, if you're not getting software updates, be sure your vehicle is joined to a wi-fi network where you normally park it. TeslaFi.com Firmware Tracker shows that roughly 70% of the Tesla fleet has a 2019.16 version of firmware installed. Many software updates only go out to cars that are logged into wi-fi networks when they are parked. I personally seem to get software updates a couple days after the mass-deployment starts.

For the OP, rear collision alarms are good with me. 10 years ago while on the motorcycle while waiting to make a left turn into my neighborhood, I was just about wiped out by an inattentive driver. They looked down at their radio and didn't see my turn signal or brake lights. Luckily, they looked up in time to go into a full panic stop. Hearing screeching tires behind me, I popped the clutch to try and get moving a little. I got moving a little, but still got tapped from behind (bent the exhaust into the tire, melted the tire a little, but I didn't fall down, so not crazy damage). I still leave extra space between me and the vehicle in front of me and pay attention to vehicles behind me as I slow down. I'll run ""orange"" (yellow/red) lights when I see the person behind me is tailgating bad enough that they wouldn't be able to stop if I did.

The changes to the EV rate schedule will also devalue most of your generation down to the Off-Peak rate with the change to Off-Peak hours going to midnight to 3pm.

I thought it was a very positive update on Starlink yesterday.

Successful deployment and testing of Starlink's first 60 satellites over the next few days should significantly increase Starlink's probability of building a viable business.

Key updates:

Recent Spacex funding rounds have been oversubscribed (disproving TSLAQ's SpaceXQ FUD). Elon thinks Spacex now has enough capital to get Starlink operational.
Targeting 3-5% of the $1trn worldwide telecommunications revenue. So $30-50bn revenue.
60 satellites in first launch. 12 launches will cover the US. 24 will provide decent global coverage. Can begin selling services with c.400 satellites. Need c.1000 to be economically viable. Will continue to add satellites to meet demand.
Falcons can potentially launch 1-2k per year.
Targeting sub-20ms latency
Each launch has ""about a terabit of useful connectivity"".
Each Starlink costs more to launch than it does to make, even with the reused Falcon 9.
Assuming a launch cost of $20m for a reused Falcon, these updates suggest a c.$333k launch cost per satellite and below $333k production cost. I don't see how Oneweb competes with this when it looks like they are paying $50m per launch of c.30 satellites (so $1.7m per satellite, which are also much smaller), with an initial production cost of $1m (targeting $0.5m) and what looks like only 60% of Starlink's bandwidth per satellite (implied by numbers here Musk says Starlink “economically viable” with around 1,000 satellites - SpaceNews.com). So it looks like SpaceX capex cost per Gigabit/second is at least 6x lower, perhaps 10x.
If this satellite deployment goes well, I expect Elon will be thinking the global satellite broadband race is also ""Game, set and match"".
""

What is that plan for ground antenna? US citizens need to be able to buy them to use Starlink by end 2019.

White On White Unicorn FSD delivered today !
393xxx vin and 5/19 build

The Good:
No mechanical complaints, paint, what I could see looked ok.
White is harder to inspected than darker colors showing white defects.
The late afternoon sun showed the dirty rag glass windshield
swirls from amateur detailing.
Couple of smudges on white door panels, a baby wipe made quick work of that.

The Bad:
Was delivered with 2019.7.206 software, already experienced
dreaded screen flicker corruption and reboot.
When that first happened it corrupted my usb drive for music and dash cam 

Car was charging on my adapter but when placed back in the car they kept the Nema 14-50 adapter. Was told it’s no longer included. No amount Of arguing would suffice.
I was charged $15 dollars to get one to take home
No Phone cables but the J1772 adapter was furnished.

The Ugly
Delivery specialist was professional.
Somewhat rushed. Strange because there were no delivery’s after mine.
And with a number of my questions, let’s say, Misinformed.
As an example I Was told 7.206 software was the very latest.
No sentry mode.

Car is wonderful, and would do it again

While technically all Tesla's sold in Canadian and American markets are interchangable from the point of view of equipment, there is a different issue driving the upswing in demand in Canada right now.

The $5K National EV rebate (plus some Provincial credits) apply ONLY to the Model 3 SR+

So demand for high-end Model 3s (or even S/X) has not be affected, therefore Tesla should be able to match supply with expected demand easily for those variants.

My estimate is ~5,100 SR+ Model 3s (80% of all rebates issued) will be purchased in British Columbia alone BEFORE the $32M Provincial EV rebate budget is exhausted.

The B.C. program is averaging ~72 SR+ claims per day since inception. With a $32M budget, that's approx. 10 weeks of sales, or fully subscribe BEFORE end of 2019Q2.

Deliveries will likely spread into Q3. That's a FULL ship's worth of Model 3s to send by truck! These problems, I like. 

Of course, the rest of Canada is extra. The above is BC only, with all deliveries taking place in Vancouver, only a couple hrs up the I-5 N of Seattle so v.good logistics for Tesla.

So the first Model 3 should be inspected (in Australia) on the 1st of June, however the photo on the RVCS search page showed a RHD model in the photo, but couldn't tell if it was taken in Australia.

I just noticed that energy buffer (reported by BMS in scan my Tesla) has increased from 4 to 5 kWh after updating my MX 100D to 2019.16.2. Recent fires due to charging of deeply discharged batteries? Ironically, full typical range being reported as before. Any thoughts why Tesla did that?
""

Interesting find. Your 100% SOC range will look the same but I’d imagine anything <100% will show slightly less range than before. No idea why it was increased other than maybe they’re seeing more early shutdowns (prior to 0% being displayed) so they’re increasing the “pad” on the bottom end.",,0,0,0,0

Driving out in my one month old Model 3 Dual Motor LR yesterday, the screen had a warning ""Front motor temporarily disabled"". Drove out on 1 motor, to a nearby SuperCharger.

The easiest is to ignore it as a fluke but I do feel a bit anxious - and am thrilled to have gone with the dual motors

Your math is not adding up. 150 miles would be around 50% on a 100 kWh battery in a model X. Start at 30% and you reach 80% for that trip. Or are you assuming you will end up at a lower state of charge than you arrived? Either way you will be charging more than 15 minutes I'm pretty sure.",,0,0,0,0

I've seen this mentioned a few times the last couple of days, and I feel like I need to respond.

Everyone looking for the most amazing inventory deals, please realize that no matter how they are found, they last only minutes before someone sees it and buys the car.

Besides EV-CPO and the other sites, there are A LOT of independent people constantly searching Tesla's site on their own for a good deal, either manually by plugging in zip codes, or macros, or their own API scripts (I've helped a few people do this for their own use). So the actual window of time these deals are available to be captured by any website is very, very short. And it's not possible to scan every zip code and every car on Tesla's site every four minutes to capture every possible deal or listed car (well, you can try, but Tesla will actively ban your IP address if you try too hard).

I'm sure there are lots of amazing deals that EV-CPO caught based solely on good timing, that other sites didn't catch before they were snatched up and delisted. Will EV-CPO miss a few good deals because they're listed so briefly? Sure. But so will every other site out there. For the inventory cars with the biggest discounts, all the sites use the same API and access methods, so really, it just gets down to which site (or other independent users or their scripts) found the good deals first. 

And I know there have been lots of amazing deals people have gotten that no site had time to catch.
""

Thank you for such a great tool. Timing, as you state, is essential In finding a good deal. After loosing out on 3 cars because of slow response getting photos, I finally scored a win last March. I took delivery of my 2015 S85D with only 12,004 miles on April 3, 2019. The filters allowed me to search for the options I was looking for at a great price!

↑

Here's another reason why I think we need CCS support: to avoid becoming completely dependent on a single company that can change prices at will. Case in point, in Germany Tesla just raised the rates to 0.42 EUR/kWh, which is roughly twice the previous minute-based pricing, and more expensive than driving on Diesel (see this video if you understand German). In contrast, the big roaming providers typically charge about 0.25-0.30 EUR per kWh. Now Model 3 drivers in Europe are in a good position, because they can simply switch to another network. Model S/X drivers don't have that option as long as there is no CCS adapter ...

Regarding Chademo, not only is the adapter expensive, unwieldy and limited to 50kW, it is also pretty clear that Chademo is dying in the US. Nissan is the only car maker left that still sells cars with Chademo here, and that will not be enough to keep it economically viable in the next few years as more and more CCS cars go on sale. So yes, I would much prefer CCS. Not sure if the situation is different in Canada though (is there some entity like Electrify America that is pumping hundreds of millions primarily into CCS infrastructure?).

Maybe that’s why they’re not enthusiastically supporting m3 owners ability to charge on other standards because it will lessen their ability to

Tesla makes over 5,000 of these every week. If you look hard enough you will be able to find flaws. I have seen published check lists where they advocate a buyer go over every inch of their car with high intensity lighting, plus use sophisticated paint thickness measurements to make sure their paint is even over every panel. Tough standard for any volume manufacturer to attain.

Problem is that even if Tesla repaints the problem areas, a vigilant inspector will still be able to locate flaws. For the most picky, nothing will ever be good enough.

Balancing this all out, their have also been many reports form new owners stating that to them their new Tesla has been delivered in a flawless condition. Shows that it can be done, but perhaps not on every single car at delivery.

Some high end cars may have higher quality paint, but even on those they are not always show quality.
If your car can be fixed for $200-$300 at a detail shop to get ready for an aftermarket ceramic coating, that is pretty normal for most production vehicles. Most all detailers will go over their cars with a fine tooth comb to prepare them for the very expensive ceramic coatings. They typically use powerful buffers all over the cars to smooth down the production finishes.

Some small fish eye, orange peal or other imperfections are pretty normal for high production paint booths. Show car finishes are very expensive and time consuming. 

Understand Tesla not wanting to pay for this detailing and prep work for an unauthorized shop. (also understand that the owner also would like to find someone else to pick up their tab for the prep).

On the other hand, if a new owner sees significant scratches, large paint runs or obvious signs of a defective paint job, it would be the obligation of Tesla to make it right.",,0,0,0,0

Columbia, SC
Columbia has a charger but it is poorly placed for anyone traveling along I-26. For example, a trip from Charleston to Greenville would require a detour of over 20 minutes to hit either Columbia or Santee since there are no chargers along I-26.

New Bern, NC (Or Morehead City)
New Bern would be a good location to serve the set of beaches like Atlantic Beach in the middle of the NC coast. Right now there aren’t any chargers along the routes from central NC to any of the beaches in that area.

Nags Head, NC

Especially considering that one huge reason for Scotland to vote no on independence was EU membership.

Now, they're likely out of the EU either way, and their only way back in is independence.

As far as delays on getting back in, my guess is that, considering that Scotland voted to remain in the first place, even if EU membership was delayed, trade and policy deals could be quickly reached to resume the status quo from before Brexit, with new (albeit much longer) shipping channels being created to bypass England.
""

You Americans have a curious view of Scotland etc. It is true many Scots dislike England. However, leaving the UK is like Texas wanting to leave the US when Trump left the TPP in order to stay in the TPP because of their loyalty to Canada. England is not really a country in its own right - no English parliament etc. We are all governed by the UK. The Scottish parliament is new and has less autonomy than a US State.

How do I perceive myself in order of priority (pre Brexit vote):

1) Tesla / Elon fanboi etc.
2) Member of planet earth - I grew up watching Star Trek and looking to expand this one
3) British / UK citizen (Military, Government, we enter the Olympics as Great Britain although not important to me)
4) Southern English / London area citizen - my workplaces in the past 5 have been wonderfully cosmopolitan
5) Arsenal fan
6) English citizen - haven't been to Northern England, Scotland, Wales, in 5+ years but go to Europe continent regularly (we are 2 hrs by train to Paris). Never been to Ireland or N Ireland. I am only English when we are doing well in the soccer World Cup. St George's flag is vilified increasingly - symbol of English football hooligans.
7) European citizen. Norway / Switzerland are more important to me than Latvia etc. I have been to Switzerland and plan to go to Norway.
8) Member of EU. We don't use Euro, not members of Schengen, can't easily / cheaply drive across the continent like many other EU countries where another country is just an hour's drive away. 
9) Member of the Commonwealth although many personal ties with India, Canada, Australia, New Zealand

Being a member of the EU has felt less important to us and that comes from a remainer... We are learning that perhaps it is more important than we thought. This is why we got ourselves into this mess.

It is also true however that if you repeated this for a Scot, Scotland would be significantly higher than England for me and member of UK lower. Having said that, the idea that they would vote to leave UK just seems mad to me. 100's of years of deep integration at every level including logistics, business, people & culture.",,0,0,0,0

Exactly. It would be super annoying if there’s a line at a supercharger and some douche (or more than one douche) is charging to 100%.
""

Here's another issue. Everybody's analysis is about local charging or charging on trips as if there is always a conveniently located charger where you are going. Even the in car navigator will route you to a destination with only 15% left in your battery without regard to getting to a charger after your trip is done. 

On one of my longer trips my last opportunity to charge is Knoxville, TN. From there to my destination is over 60 miles. If I don't put as much charge on the car as I can, I won't be able to do the local driving I need and return to a useful charger. I may not charge to 100%, but I always charge to at least 90% there. 




I say up the idle fee as well so that owners are back in their cars and ready to go ASAP. As others have said in high restate areas it would be bad practice to build large superchargers in New York City or Downtown LA. They really should have large superchargers outside the city to facilitate road trips.

And more level 2 tesla destination in grocery store malls, CVS, Targets, Trader Joe’s, Walmart’s etc...

I only supercharger on road trips so the 80% limit caught me off guard when I discovered it but it makes sense to me. I haven’t supercharged since the first week I got the car in late April. I personally like to charge up to 80 because I don’t like the idea of arriving to my destination with 15% of soc.
""

So you want someone, I assume Tesla, to install lots of new L2 chargers in shopping areas, but the idea of adding more Superchargers to relieve the congestion areas is not a good idea??? 

Considering that L2 chargers operate at less than a tenth the rate of a Supercharger and that the L2 chargers can't possibly replace a Supercharger on trips, there really is no comparison and the Superchargers are more cost effective.",,0,0,0,0

but from what I can see in your post you must be used to running lots of red lights because that intersection is huge and you appear to be two car lengths from its beginning.

I find it hard to judge distance from the car with that front camera, the angle and field view of the camera is such that you can't really judge the front of the vehicle directly, so I'm not sure exactly what the distance was and what it'd look like and how much room they had to brake in time, but they seem to have entered the intersection before the light turned red. If you're past the stop line prior to the red you aren't technically running it.

With the caveat that it isn't exactly clear when the vehicle braked and when the driver is overriding with the accelerator, because that telemetry isn't overlaid in the stock Model 3 camera footage;

Watching it again it really looks like the vehicle in front of them slowed, as the gap closed, so almost certainly TACC was reacting to traffic in front as intended. I can't really see the 2nd in-front vehicle at the end, if the vehicle in front closed that gap too then definitely TACC reacts to that. It adjusts follow distance not just on the first vehicle but another vehicle deep in front, and is pretty sensitive to speed delta changes going on. Which IMO is a very good thing.",,0,0,0,0

Definitely get a quote generated from Tesla. Shoot an email to your service center and note that you left a voicemail, maybe it’ll be easier for them to send it straight to you through email. From what I understand, Tesla doesn’t work with insurance (at least on glass repairs?) so you'll definitely want to know for sure what you’re paying out of pocket and what Geico will cover.

I would’ve suggested seeing if Safelite would repair it for probably about 100 bucks (and Geico covered the repair costs with no deductible when I had them repair my windshield) but from what I understand, repairs near the edges of glass is discouraged, and some Safelite locations won’t touch anything that aren’t windshields on a Tesla.
""

It definitely cannot be repaired as it is cracked on the edge - at least not to looking like stock which I want. As far as getting the quote from Tesla - not only have they not returned my numerous calls and voicemails, but when they finally did reach out via text, it was to inform me that my appointment for this Monday (tomorrow) is being cancelled because ""there is currently a constraint supply on the part"" They said ""We have moved forward with escalating the concern in order to assist with getting the part sooner. However, we currently do not have an estimated time of arrival"" Great.....no reply when replied asking for itemized quote.



GreenMtnM3 said:
↑

If you are considering a repair, I would ensure that Safelite, or the vendor you plan to use for the repair, has the replacement glass in stock before they start the repair. Based on Geico's recommendation, I had Safelite repair a very small chip in my windshield on May 6. The repair 'failed' according to the technician and now I have a 20"" crack running across the drivers side of the windshield. On Tuesday, Safelite called to say that they had the windshield in stock and scheduled an appointment for me for the following Monday. The next day someone else called me and said that no, they did not in fact have the windshield, and it would likely be a few weeks, as Tesla model 3 windshields are taking a while to get. Oh, yeah Geico states that since Safelite cracked the windshield, they should replace it and I should not have to pay the deductible. Safelite says no way, I need to pay the $500 deductible. its all academic at this point, since they don't have the windshield to replace it, and the crack grows a little longer each day....

I'm not overly sold on Safelite's repair abilities. That being said, a friend here did have her model 3 windshield successfully repaired by them, so I admit that I'm only one (slightly bitter) data point.

This post motivated me to give my buddies at Safelite a call, since it has been 3 weeks since they cracked my winshield while trying to repair it and I have not heard from them. After 10 minutes on hold and two customer service people, I was told that they are having trouble getting the windshield from Tesla and it will likely be three weeks. I pointed out that I was told 3 weeks ago that it would be three weeks and the customer service rep seemed stumped. I think they are just guessing, no clue. I advised them that they may not want to undertake repairs on glass that they can not replace without warning customers of this risk, but he didn't seem to understand this concept. Still not impressed with Safelite. I get it, it takes a while to get parts from Tesla, but the Safelite customer service folks seem so clueless!

@GreenMtnM3 - that stinks that they are putting you through the hassle. I have had a good experience with them years ago where they came to my work and replaced a windshield of a Nissan 350z I used to own while I was working. I think the Model 3 and Tesla's constrain issues have a negative downstream impact on companies like them who aren't used to dealing with those situations. Not giving excuses for them, as they should still have better customer service. Many people/customer service depts don't understand that an honest answer is better than a guess when it comes to expectation setting, even if the honest answer is ""there's no way for us to know."" They need to be able to communicate that up front. At the end of the day - I am working with Tesla directly and even THEY don't know when the part will be available - so how would a downstream service company know?",,0,0,0,0

Als toekomstige eigenaar van een Model 3 Performance had ik graag deze topic gestart zodat iedereen die deze uitvoering bezit (of ooit zal bezitten) kan geholpen worden in zijn of haar zoektocht naar nieuwe velgen en/of banden.

Zoals de meesten onder ons weten komt de Performance Package met 20"" velgen en grotere remblokken. Dit zorgt ervoor dat het (op moment van schrijven) niet eenvoudig is om een passende velgen set te vinden voor bvb. winterbanden en/of een andere 'look' te bekomen.

Momenteel is T-Sportline (US) de enige die aangepaste velgen (18"", 19"" en 20"") levert voor de Model 3 Performance Package versie. Dus als er iemand een velg of band vindt die past, laat het gerust weten in de commentaren!

Banden maten:
Tesla stock 20"": 235/35R20 front, 275/30R20 rear (staggered).

Zomer banden 20"" (stock):

this +1000

tesla will be limiting charging to 80% at stations where there is probably an alternative station pithing 20, 30, or 40 miles.

so you have the option of going there and topping up. the issue here becomes a necessary detour, or somewhat prolonged road trip b/c charging to 100% avoids a second SC stop or devotion to second SCer. so yes. even though you can still make it to your destination, there is an extra inconvenience, that some of is feel we are entitled to be exempt from.

I personally disagree with this idea of entitlement. we all need to learn to share what is in effect a limited, and as it turns out -- occasionally scarce -- resource.



swegman said:

e, if the distance from supercharger A to supercharger B is 160 miles, I need to charge to an indicated battery range of 210 miles.

yes, you need a buffer but this is probably not going to be happening in places where the nearest SCer is 150 or 200 miles away so I think you are safe. as I wrote above, it might happen in places where there are SCers 50 miles away, but the 80% restriction might be an inconvenience at best.



d21mike said:

Those that are happy with making many stops along the way to reduce the time at each stop go for it. But those of us that would rather have breakfast prior to a long trip home and would like to start a with 100% charge should not be FORCED to make multiple stops along the way.
""

Wow.

What makes your driving habits any more valid or correct than mine? are you, like, the Emperor of the Tesla Super Charger highway that your driving habits can just trample on the rest of us peasants without the slightest consideration?

i'm only being faintly facetious here.

do you hear the entitlement in your statement? there are thousands of Teslas on the road. and a limited number of chargers with limited capacity. you can have unlimited free for like supercharging to abuse all you want. this is your right -- actually I personally don't believe that, but i'll play along b/c it sounds like you think you own the whole world and we are your humble servants. Thing is -- come back at 3 in the morning when your favorite SCer site is not 6 cars deep waiting for a charge and pull as many free electrons from the SCer as your callous little heart can stand.

in the meantime, I hope the rest of us will be happy to act in a more neighborly manner and realize that other drivers have similar needs to the SCer network and sitting around for 30 minutes going from 95 to 100% SOC is neither good use of your own time, nor good use of Teala's SCer network.

I too wish that we could wave our magic wands and increase SCer charge rates and capacity but the technology is just not there yet. in 50 years perhaps we will have be able to replenish 500 miles in 5 minutes so all of the cry babies who miss their ICE road trip habits can, you know, shave a few extra minutes off their 8 hour road trip while risking falling asleep at the wheel and putting themselves and god-knows-who else in danger.

I have heard amazing things about the Toyota Camry. very reliable. and you can replenish it's full full storage capacity in roughly 5 minutes from empty today!! Want something a little more Luxe? Toyota's Lexus line makes lovely vehicles. the Germans IIRC also have this technology and some American brands as well, if you would rather go the patriotic route.. and, best of all, you never have to be told to move your stinking Tesla so one of us peasants might get a charge.

They'll just change the rules if that happens. Similar to how Mazda rotary cars won all the races (in their class) because of the way engine volume was defined until the rules were changed.
""

There are ways that you could balance it.

The first is to play to the strengths and weaknesses of each car. The Roadster is likely to be heavy, and that will negatively affect its handling. So, while it might leave some ICE hypercars behind, they may well catch up in the corners. The SpaceX package would help offset that, but that's something that physics engines would need to be modified to model. In that case, some tracks would greatly favor the Roadster, some would favor the ICE hypercars. (Also, endurance races may change that as well - you could have it where the Roadster blasts pasts everything by a lot, but then has a 30 minute pit stop every stint, where the ICE hypercars have a 30 second pit stop.)

You could, additionally, add handicaps (through a process called ""balance of performance""), which is the approach used in actual road car-derived racing series nowadays. Add weight, limit aerodynamic devices, reduce power, to bring cars together in performance.

And then, there's simply the rule that some games go for - if something can't be balanced without nerfing it too much, or if the manufacturer doesn't want it to be compared to other vehicles, it can only race against itself. (Ride 3 does that for the Kawasaki Ninja H2 and H2R, and Assetto Corsa does that for some of the F1 cars (due to licensing issues).)",,0,0,0,0

Actually it already does that in a lot of the country. Where I am at it is 23 cents for over 60 KW and 12 cents below. So at 60 KW you are getting 1 kwh every minute, or paying 12 cents per kwh. At 80% you are running about 35 kw or less so you are paying almost 2x, at 90 you run 25kw approaching 3x. At 95 it runs about 6 kwh. So at 95% you are paying almost 10x per kwh than you do at 70% when most charging crosses the 60 mark.

This is all based on long range model 3 150 kwh supercharging as graphed: 150kW Supercharging for Model 3

Note that the short range gets charged even more since the kw drops faster

This makes this band issue far more than cosmetic (not that cosmetic repairs caused by substandard materials or workmanship do not have to be fixed under warrantee).

The yellow bands are partially reflective. This makes any alleged software fix impossible. I find it hard to believe that Tesla is even working on something so kooky like this when it cannot possibly work. So I suspect the software fix is nothing but a rumor.

Exposing the panel to more heat and damaging radiation via a UV lamp also sounds like an unlikely fix. The screen is exposed to UV from the sun all day when parked outside.

I have lived with this problem for six months, and like many others, I am growing tired of waiting. This is a real warrantee problem and it is difficult to imagine Tesla not rectifying it.

My pump is back running this morning. I estimate it has been running since the charging stopped at 1am. I have lost 5 miles just sitting the the garage. This change is taking life out of that pump.

This can't be the final solution for the battery fires. Using miles and killing a pump daily on my car.

TuneIn support told me that Tesla doesn’t play .m3u formatted stations. The station I primarily listen to either just started serving that format to TuneIn or something else happened to make it the file format that’s being routed because it suddenly stopped working earlier this week (before I got a firmware update - still failing after).

According to the content provider (WGN), they have multiple formatted streams so TuneIn claims they’re checking to see about getting .m3u off the primary.

Is that the culprit for the other failures?

After owning my Model 3 Performance for a week I took it to get washed and waxed by a place I used to take my previous car. Upon picking it up I noticed all sorts of swirls and micro scratches. I couldn't handle this amazing new car having these imperfections so I started looking into paint protection options along with installers. I ended up taking it to Chicago Auto Pros who first performed a two step paint correction, then put on a full XPEL Ultimate wrap, and lastly applied a Gtechniq HALO coating on top of the ppf.

Knowing I was spending $8,400.00 to have all of this done I was a bit anxious to say the least... until I saw the final result. When I arrived to pick up my car I was seriously blown away by how good it looked. It was noticeably better than when I took delivery. The peace of mind I have now knowing the paint is protected from small rocks and bugs and that I can wash it without worrying about scratches and swirls is very pleasing. I can't recommend Chicago Auto Pros enough. These guys are true professionals.

3693203,Bloomberg 2019 EV Outlook,J X 3,2019-05-26 10:13:00,"With EVs you have to consider what constrains sales, what limits the market and what EV makers can do about it. Then consider the competition, ICE and how that gores. You also have to consider disruptions.

The most significant limiting factor for EVs right now is awareness. Very few people know that EVs are much better vehicles than ICE in pretty much every way possible.
At 3-5% of new sales, awareness starts to ramp and sales accelerate in a given market. Globally, EVs are yet to reach peak growth but that's right around the corner.
I am not considering hybrids as EV and a viable or relevant product, it's better to look at just BEV.

The second largest limitation are charging rates plus range. These always go together and you got to consider how fast can these evolve. Price declines for cells will be invested in this, to expand the addressable market. Think of it in term of hours driven on the highway. A M3 LR has 5h+ range and adds up to 3h in 15 mins when charging, in 7-10 years a modern M3 could offer 10h of range and 4-5h added in 5 mins.- funny enough the Roadster could offer this range in 1-2 years and 4-6h added in 15 mins. Infrastructure is a business opportunity and will grow too fast to remain a limitation.

You can also consider the green pressure and how that impacts both EVs and ICE.

The ICE trajectory, If you look at availability in the used car market, declining sales create a volume unbalance between new car and used car sales, that accelerates depreciation for ICE. Awareness about EVs, being better and the green factor will impact desirability and depreciation further. Then you got reliability and operating costs, favoring EVs and hurting ICE.
ICE complying with regulations increases sticker price while EVs need to invest in charging and range but can reduce costs elsewhere and once charging rates are sufficient, take advantage of cheaper cells to reduce costs further.
So you got huge issues for ICE when it comes to depreciation, made worse by rising costs.

Then you got car as a service, able to offer up to 10 times better value than ownership and able to expand the market for cars by a few times globally, in terms of miles.
It can be cheaper than just the gas for ICE while offering a lot more value.
Car as a service shifts the miles to electric very fast and kills ownership, if anyone is doing it right.

EVs will be practically 100% of sales before 2030 but I wouldn't count on car sales being all that relevant by then, it's all about car as a service.

Charging and range limit the addressable market right now but if those are sufficient already for a given customer, a good EV already offers much better value and fantastic cost of ownership.
Right now even the press doesn't know anything about EVs, they don't even understand that sticker price for ICE and EVs are very different animals and you can't just look at that when giving a verdict on affordability.
So far sales have been mostly driven by the green factor and Gov subs but the dynamics are changing so the historical data does not provide great value.",,0,0,0,0

3693210,"Tesla, TSLA & the Investment World: the 2019 Investors' Roundtable",MartinAustin,2019-05-26 10:16:00,"Autoline discusses various aspects of the Chinese auto industry, interviewing Michael Dunne, president of Zozo Go. Electric discussed a lot of course, though at one point they say the Chinese are producing more electric cars than anyone else (fail to aggregate GWh production where Tesla is the leader). Transcript excerpt -

Michelle Krebs, Cox Automotive
We also can't leave this discussion without mentioning the other American car company, Tesla, in China... they've set things up in a little different way, does that help them?

Micheal Dunne, Zozo Go
Absolutely, they're the first foreign company to be allowed to own 100% of their operation; they're in Shanghai & Shanghai will want to make sure they're a success; the government will make sure that they've got their plant built on time and they have everything working; and on top of it all, Chinese consumers really do like the Tesla brand and really admire Elon Musk. So you've got a premium market, 2 million units a year, you have the government wanting electrics to succeed, and you've got a very strong American brand, so... they'd be one to bet on in terms of China.

Joe White, Reuters
So how beholden does Tesla become to China, you know, whatever specific entity e.g. the Shanghai government? In the sense that it seems like that Chinese plant and all the infrastructure they're building there is being financed by bank loans from Chinese banks and Chinese entities... I mean how does that work? Seems now they're now beholden to some great degree to what Chinese consumers and government officials would like?

Micheal Dunne, Zozo Go
They're part of the Chinese family for better or for worse... and as friends of mine in China say, think of the Chinese government as the parents, and they say ""would you like to have this little piece of candy? OK then you should do these things... and you will have your piece of candy."" Now, it's a little bit of an exaggeration, but not too much. The Chinese Communist Party has done an amazing job of harnessing the energies of millions of entrepreneurs and foreign companies to innovate, to invest and to get things done, and so far that formula has worked pretty effectively.

John Mcelroy, host
Michael I'd like to hear your thoughts on what they call China Speed... how things get done so quickly. Joe just mentioned Tesla and the plant that they're putting in Shanghai, they broke ground this year; supposed to be building cars by the end of this year... a physical impossibility to do in the United States or probably the western world. I've talked to other westerners [designers] who work for Chinese companies, and they're astounded at... they'll pen something and BANG it seems like the next afternoon there's a prototype running around. Talk a little bit about that and the challenge that poses, especially for the U.S. auto industry.

Michael Dunne, Zozo Go
Well in China, in my own experience with my own company, and operating in China for a long time, you have an order that comes on down from on high, and once that order is released and understood, everyone goes into action. There's no deliberation, there's no discussion, what are the benefits and costs, environmental impacts - no... it's done. Contrast that here with the United States where there's a debate about... every step of the way. So this gives China probably one of its greatest advantages, it can move every quickly to establish infrastructure, a new plant, charging stations, you name it, they really have a big edge because there's no debate. The decision is made by the Party at the central level or city level, that's it.",,0,0,0,0

By reading all the restrictions/limitations/warnings implied in operating safely the AP/FSD, considering that you need to give your undivided attention to the system while keeping 100% of the time your hands on the wheel. Also expecting unexpected actions from the car, I wonder if it is even worth to invest in this system today.
""

Therein lies the problem with Tesla's ""AP is safer"" argument: disclaimers absolve AP/EAP of responsibility to work properly under any and all conditions, yet Tesla and its fans keep arguing that the AP is still safer than not using it. Even though none of us, outside of Tesla, have seen the data to back up that safety claim. 

Thus that claim is propagated on faith, not data. Thus we cross into the domain of religious convictions, and not scientific debate, with all the vitriol that comes with that territory.

Those two arguments are logically and morally in contradiction with each other.
AP can't be safer, if the company is telling you it isn't expected to work properly... just about ever.

It's mostly a matter of time before a sympathetic jury puts a price tag on that fallacy.

My personal, statistically unsubstantiated, belief is that AP is a helpful driver aid tool that improves safety on average, but is deadly under certain undocumented circumstances. 

a

P.S.: The more I drive with AP ON, and the more I read these forums, the better I build up my personal heuristics on when I expect AP to fail. I wish Tesla was honest and upfront with sharing those corner cases with the owners of its products, but I also understand why doing so would be bad publicity for the company, and an ego deflating event for Elon.

3693214,Yellow bands of death can disable some touchscreen controls,Kevin Bohacz,2019-05-26 10:16:00,"The yellow bands of death (yellow boarders on my touchscreen) are so bad on my 11/2017 build MS 100D that under some conditions I cannot see some of the touchscreen controls, and therefore cannot operate aspects of the car such as the heater controls and volume at the bottom the screen, map settings on the right side, and more. This makes this band issue far more than cosmetic (not that cosmetic repairs caused by substandard materials or workmanship do not have to be fixed under warrantee).

The yellow bands are partially reflective. This makes any alleged software fix impossible. I find it hard to believe that Tesla is even working on something so kooky like this when it cannot possibly work. So I suspect the software fix is nothing but a rumor.

Exposing the panel to more heat and damaging radiation via a UV lamp also sounds like an unlikely fix. The screen is exposed to UV from the sun all day when parked outside.

I have lived with this problem for six months, and like many others, I am growing tired of waiting. This is a real warrantee problem and it is difficult to imagine Tesla not rectifying it.

I have had nothing but fantastic customer service from Tesla. The last I heard for my SC was that fixed replacement panels are expected sometime soon (no actual date). I hope this is still Tesla's plan. I’d hate to think of the devastating problems Tesla would have with its customers otherwise.

Although Tesla has told me that the 63 kW capacity listed on our navigation systems is correct, it would be a simple matter for someone with a low state of charge to see if their charging rate exceeds 63 kW to resolve this question.

A) that’s a problem, and Tesla’s trying to correct it. It SHOULD be to minimize your charge time for the benefit of all SC users
B) if you are at a half empty charger you can charge to 100% and sit idle and enjoy your meal, fine. If it’s busy Tesla wants you to interrupt your precious meal break to let someone else use the SC. That seems abundantly fair to me.

Skyrocketing Tesla Sales Force Mercedes Dealer In Norway To Face A Kodak Moment | CleanTechnica

Notably, the Tesla Model 3 accounted for 31% of all passenger auto sales in Norway in March. Due to Tesla’s cyclical delivery schedule, March was an abnormal month that basically represented the quarter’s sales for Tesla in Norway, but still, the Model 3 is far and away the top selling car in Norway in 2019 so far. It is perhaps a good time to review the graph here (on the bottom) by Nicholas Felton. Norway is far ahead in the EV adoption curve, but we expect other countries will be in the same place within 5 or so years.

This should serve as a warning to companies like Toyota that take a “wait and see” attitude toward EVs. As Tony Seba describes more clearly than anyone else I know, although a disruption starts slowly, when things hit a tipping point, demand shifts quickly and those unprepared for the change must suffer the effects of the disruption.

InsideEVs Scorecard. And arithmetic.

Jan-Apr is +7.5k vs. 2018, but ex-Tesla is -13k. Volt is now gone, leaving another hole to fill (14k units May-Dec). The new entrants - Jag I-Pace, Audi e-Tron and the Koreans might contribute 10k incremental units the next 8 months. Overall, US ex-Tesla is headed toward 150-160k vs. 170k last year.

Tesla delivered 191.5k in the US last year. They guided 360-400k worldwide for 2019. US is typically half of worldwide, so 180-200k. It's more likely to be less than more, since US was way above 50% last year and we can expect some reversion to the mean.

Way too much thought here. The base module is the same design. SR Pack has ‘24’ module, 4 of them. The module is shorter than the ‘23’ and ‘25’ modules. The number signifies the bricks in module. Bricks in 24 module are less dense, less cells per brick. Cooling tube design is same, just shorter.

Well, I'm certain they had very good predictions for the car's range when they announced it in Mar '16. Whenever they locked down the 31-cell brick configuration, they knew what the range was going to be. I suspect that was in mid '17 or earlier. As you suggest, I think what happened very late was the idea of splitting the SR into two separate configurations extract greater margins from the SR cars.
""

I think something changed with their predictions though. 310 became 325 on the LR (after delivery).
It was at this point that I think they dreamed up the “SR 220” becoming an “SR+ 240”, and a new “locked SR 220” at original price was dreamed up.

Did they explain what changed to take 310 to 325? Some OTA efficiency improvement? Or maybe they said that but it was just unlocking some additional low or high end (or both) usable battery capacity after they had done more stress testing on the 2170 cells.",,0,0,0,0

I might be wrong, but I think the 2015 and older cars don’t have this? Was it so, that first cars had bubbles appearing in screen, the revision to fix bubbles has this yellow borders flaw?

Yup... lol.. ridiculous isn't it? 
They shifted the problem and not fixed it, and now it seems a bunch of monkeys are in charge of the company thinking they can either postpone this issue for as long as possible, or siderail it long enough for people to just give up and pay for the fix with no out of pocket on them. 

Hence why i dont think they realize its more expensive for handle a law suit which will obvious end in them requiring to fix the problem additionally pay out everyone who has had problems with the screens, and also paying millions on lawyer fee's. 

Average payout to a class action lawyer to a large corp is roughly anywhere between 10-25 million. 
Thats a lot of screens they could of just replaced @ there cost just recouping the lawyer fee's which they can easily avoid, and they will lose because Ford Lost, and im very sure Ford has more powerful lawyers then Tesla has since Tesla has been flipping law firms left and right.

If you are right and the latest cars are not susceptible to this, that means Tesla has a good parts to make new cars with, which means they should be swapping screens with new, non-defective parts, right?

Well according to more threads ive read here and also on Tesla.com, it says the new screens have been addressed and fixed.
They stopped replacing them, because all of a sudden massive amounts of people started filing claims and i think they could not handle the back end. 

Who knows it maybe temporary, so they can spread the supply out.
But i can tell you one thing.. you do not piss off your customers who can afford cars with price tags like these.
These people usually got where they are because they are frugal with money, and know when not to 
""pick up that bar of soap when it hits the floor so to speak"". 

So yea, definitely they will piss off someone here who is a class action lawyer, and most likely end up losing this if this UV fix does not work, on top end up paying settlement for all the grief it has caused people.

I am a fan of @Tsportline. I purchased one of their first sets of gray turbine 20's for the S (after hounding them at the '14 Teslive event to manufacture 20s). The manufacture/model specific wheels they offer require no centering rings, utilize OEM lug nuts, and accept center caps for an easy peasy swap.

Regardless of diameter, some owners have switched to a 245 or a 255 width tire for added performance as I have. These slightly wider tires are also taller which increases the sidewall height a tad (every little bit may help). I am sure TSportline or others on this forum have knowledge what size tires will clear along with the TSportline wheel width requirements if one chooses a smidgen wider/taller tire that will also reduce the speedo accuracy marginally IMO.

Good - luck!

18s = efficient and practical
19s = aesthetics? and performance
20s = posers
""

I'm very green when it comes to wheels and tires. I don't know what would be best for the wheel size, and didn't even really know you could choose different width tires for the same wheel size.

The Tesla Model 3 Wheel and Tire Guide

I am going to pull the trigger on the 19"" or 18"" from this list (the TSS range, not OEM) but it doesn't state the tire spec for the wheel. The packages they offer of wheel + tire also doesn't say which tire you get, but I think I'd want something like the Pilot Sport A/S 235/45R18.

No, I can tell you with certainty that is not the case. The situation here is that the funding is planned and scheduled a year ahead of time. Government money is not just in one big bank account. They plan out when money is needed throughout the year and negotiate investments and lending to fit that planned schedule. Right now the demand for the program is greater than expected and they need funds sooner. That has them scrambling to write memos explaining to finance management and politicians why they didn’t expect this, and what the impact would be on people etc..

Hey, I ordered a similar configuration (but with FSD) exactly a week ago today (May 16th). No VIN or delivery date and for the first few days I called my delivery rep every day to have him search.

All there are are SR+ gray with 19"" which I don't want.

Overall it just depends your configuration and the availability around your area. Some people with white interiors have waited almost two months without a VIN or contact, and others order and the next day they get matched with something close to their area. It all depends.

I heard a rumor that if the Nav sent you there then it doesn't limit you to 80% but am not near someplace I can test that.

Actually the way that I was told that it works is that if you have another destination plugged in beyond the charger you are currently using then it will allow you to go beyond the 80% ceiling. 

While it was before this most recent update, I saw something similar to this on my most recent journey. I had a string of three chargers plugged in to the Nav and when I stopped at the second one, in order to reach the third I would have to charge to nearly 100%, the car just kept on charging right beyond the ""charge limit"" of 90% that I usually set on road trips without me doing anything.

This probably depends on the underwriter for the insurance. My AAA insurance is underwritten by CSAA and my rates only rose about $38/month from my previous car (a Chevy Volt).

Anyway, be careful with anecdotes. There are all kinds of reasons people keep their cars parked there past 80%. Some are having a long lunch break, some are trying to milk the system, some are trying to avoid multiple stops while on a trip.

Similarly, not everyone has the same time constraints, either.

Disagree with the theory that today's myopic culture is driven strictly by scarcity. And I use the term myopic deliberately, as I do not believe it is pure selfishness. There are a lot of factors, part of it is that we've had a lot of economic success that has prevented my generation at least from learning what real sacrifice is. Part of it is that technology has made information extremely easy to obtain. Ditto entertainment.

Still, 40 kW in 15 minutes is 160 kW which is much more than any charger I've seen will do. I guess that's the high end of your point and not 15 minutes, still, those numbers all assume perfect charging (not sharing a pair) and a model 3 I suppose. It is also based on always having a convenient charger when you need a charge. My travels take me by Superchargers only on the road and if I don't charge fully, I often don't have enough to reach a Supercharger and either have to drive out of my way or stop at an L2 charger. 

I think yesterday even with the highway driving I saw my trip usage was significantly below 333 Wh/mi which is unusual in a model X. I still had 36% when I stopped to charge. I've got 82% now and there's a chance I might have enough to not stop to charge on the way home if I don't do much local driving this weekend. That will be a first I think.

↑

Intussen heb ik het adres van het Belgische hoofd van UNECE ITC doorgestuurd gekregen (Kristof Schockaert), en hem het volgende doorgestuurd:

Beste heer Schockaert,

Ik hoop dat ik het juiste adres heb doorgekregen en dat u aan het hoofd staat van de Inland Transport Committee van UNECE?

Ik schrijf u in verband met de recent ingevoerde regels met betrekking tot de automatische besturing van auto's, die relatief zware beperkingen opleggen die volgens mij zelfs onnodige ongevallen zullen veroorzaken.

Ik maak mij niet zo zeer zorgen om het feit dat bepaalde recente ontwikkelingen afgeremd worden zodat we in Europa langer moeten wachten op functionaliteit die reeds beschikbaar is in de VS (zoals het ietwat mallotige ""advanced summon"" van Tesla) maar wel om het gevaar dat bepaalde beperkingen daadwerkelijk blijken te betekenen voor de verkeersveiligheid wanneer ze toegepast worden in bestaande goed werkende systemen.

Zo is er een limiet ingevoerd op de hoeveelheid laterale acceleratie die toegelaten is, namelijk 3 m/s^2 (volgens ECE/TRANS/WP.29/2017/10 punt 5.6.2.1.3.). Ik begrijp zeer goed waarom deze regel is ingevoerd, namelijk om te vermijden dat het systeem een plotse ""hardover"" veroorzaakt waarbij de bestuurder onmogelijk snel genoeg kan reageren om een resulterend ongeval te vermijden. De oplossing is echter een perfect voorbeeld van wat men in het Frans een ""fausse bonne idée"" noemt. Als het systeem nu een bocht tegenkomt aan een snelheid waarbij een hogere laterale acceleratie nodig is om de bocht te nemen, moet het systeem nu verplicht uitschakelen en dus uit de bocht gaan! Als het de bocht volgt, faalt het de certificatietest (annex 8 punt 3.2.2). U moet toch toegeven dat dat te absurd is voor woorden?

Zeer recent is er bij Tesla een software-update doorgevoerd voor Model S/X waarbij deze limiet wordt gerespecteerd, en het regent onmiddellijk berichten van verontruste chauffeurs die, op plaatsen waar hun wagen vroeger op autopilot probleemloos de bocht nam, plots luide waarschuwingssignalen krijgen en onmiddellijk moeten overnemen terwijl hun auto over de middellijn op het vak van de tegenliggers gaat. Er staan al dashcam-video's op youtube waarbij de verraste chauffeur maar op het nippertje een ongeval kon vermijden Dat kan toch nooit de bedoeling zijn van een regel die tot doel heeft de veiligheid te bevorderen?!

Bij mijn weten zijn er nog geen ongevallen veroorzaakt door automatische stuursystemen die plots meer dan 3 m/s^2 laterale acceleratie veroorzaken op een ongepast moment. Bovendien lijken lagere acceleraties al meer dan voldoende om in een fractie van een seconde een ongeval te veroorzaken. De ingevoerde regel is dus een oplossing voor een onbestaand probleem die niet eens dat probleem oplost maar intussen wel nieuwe gevaren veroorzaakt die met een veel grotere waarschijnlijkheid tot ongevallen zullen leiden.

Een ander voorbeeld is de vereiste dat het systeem zichzelf moet uitschakelen indien 65 seconden lang geen handen op het stuur gedetecteerd worden. Wat als de chauffeur een hartaanval krijgt? De uitschakeling zorgt dan gegarandeerd voor een ongeval terwijl het perfect mogelijk zou zijn om het systeem de wagen gradueel te laten vertragen en verder te navigeren naar een veilige stopplaats. Ook hier zorgt de wetgeving er dus voor dat de auto verplicht een ongeval moet veroorzaken.

Nog een voorbeeld is de timeout bij een rijstrookverandering. In de VS kan je je richtingaanwijzer aanzetten om van rijstrook te veranderen, waarna de auto zijn snelheid aanpast om een opening te zoeken en vervolgens zeer vlot en veilig op de andere rijstrook te gaan. Ook dit is in Europa onmogelijk gemaakt: indien de rijstrookverandering niet binnen de vijf seconden wordt uitgevoerd, wordt deze abrupt afgebroken, wat bijzonder verrassend is voor achterliggers en tot ongevallen kan leiden.

Ik weet niet zeker of u ook verantwoordelijk bent voor de werking van adaptive cruise control, maar ook hier zie ik belangrijke verschillen tussen de Europese en de Amerikaanse versie die mogelijk hun oorsprong hebben in reglementering. Deze week nog heb ik een demonstratierit gekregen in een Tesla in de VS waarbij ik zeer aangenaam verrast was over de vloeiendheid waarmee die zijn snelheid regelde in functie van de andere weggebruikers. Hiermee vergeleken is de TACC van mijn Europese Tesla zo goed als onbruikbaar: hij past de hele tijd op oncomfortabele en oneconomische manier zijn snelheid aan om zo exact mogelijk de juiste tussenafstand te behouden zonder enige flexibiliteit, continu wisselend tussen acceleratie en deceleratie, en gaat zwaar op de rem staan als een andere auto invoegt, wat tot levensgevaarlijke situaties kan leiden met achteropkomend verkeer dat zo'n overdreven reactie niet verwacht.


Ik hoop dat u het bovenstaande in overweging kan nemen en kan delen met uw collega's die samen het beleid bepalen. Het is sowieso onbegonnen werk om met een log overheidsorgaan de bijzonder snelle evolutie van deze hoogtechnologische systemen te volgen (de hoger genoemde regels werden in 2017 opgesteld en gaan nu pas in voege treden). Tegen de tijd dat een regel is ingevoerd om een vastgesteld (of verwacht) probleem te verhelpen, is deze vaak al volledig achterhaald door de invoering van nieuwe technologie. Misschien is het in dat geval beter om meer afstand te nemen en uw richtlijnen algemener te houden in plaats van zeer specifieke technische vereisten op te stellen die reeds achterhaald zijn op het moment dat ze in voege treden?

Met vriendelijke groeten,

Michel Colman

From the lips of our Finance Minister herself on May 6th:

Monday, May 6, 2019, p.m., Issue 248

Hon. C. James: I think the member rightly talked about the work being done in EMPR with the federal program. So we’re waiting for the federal program to come into place to see whether any adjustments would need to be made over this next year with our provincial program as well. I think it’s important to note that for CleanBC, just for this fiscal year, there’s $37.3 million in contingencies in this area. A large portion of that, we expect, will be allocated towards the electric vehicle program.
​As I say, I think the budget allocated funds to the CleanBC program (of which the EV program is part of), and I think the contingency relates to the entire program, not just the EV program. That's probably largely moot, though, because, again, I suspect there are very few votes to be had by using the contingency to help heavy industry offset their tax burden (for example)--which they could do under the CleanBC program--as opposed to handing it out to individual voters buying EVs.

Again, because this is all political, I also can't imagine the Ministry of Energy and Mines, which has discretion over funding the EV program, choosing to leave a lengthy ""gap"" in funding (for example, to try and spread it out over the fiscal year), but you never know.",,0,0,0,0

Not knowing where to post this topic or if it has been posted in the past or if this is a silly question, but here goes: Is sitting in the car while it is being supercharged dangerous for people sitting in the car?

I know, stupid/silly question.

But since I am sitting in the car being supercharged, I might as well post this thread while waiting for another 30 minutes.

I just hope that I do not grow another testicle in the next few years.

I think something changed with their predictions though. 310 became 325 on the LR (after delivery).
It was at this point that I think they dreamed up the “SR 220” becoming an “SR+ 240”, and a new “locked SR 220” at original price was dreamed up.

Did they explain what changed to take 310 to 325? Some OTA efficiency improvement? Or maybe they said that but it was just unlocking some additional low or high end (or both) usable battery capacity after they had done more stress testing on the 2170 cells.
""

The 310 to 325 change appears just be a recalibration of the range indication, no actual change to usable battery capacity. So it didn't result from an engineering epiphany. It was just change in marketing approach after the initial wave had passed of 3D and 3P purchases in North America.",,0,0,0,0

I think the difference is - for people like us in US - it is not that much of an emotional issue. We can look at it more like an outside independent observer.

Just like Iraq war did. The British leaving India did. It is just inevitable. Ofcourse it is difficult to figure out with certainty what the consequences are - but the likely ones are some kind of trouble in N.I. and Scottish independence. Then there are things like disintegration of Tories & Labor party.

About Texas leaving US - yes, it can happen. But only when something really weird happens in US that Texans just hate. BTW, remember Texas is turning Democratic and some recent polls show both Biden & Sanders beating Trump there. So, the chances of Texas leaving US is receding.

↑

Now let's look at 3P-20"" energy consumption at highway speeds. With no wind, just increasing the speed from 75 to 79 mph increases consumption by 6.6%. Decreasing speed from 75 to 71 mph decreases consumption by 6.2%.

Now let's have this car stay at 75 mph but add a 4 mph straight-on headwind. Energy consumption increases by 10.7%. With a 4 mph tailwind, consumption decreases by 9.6%. I was surprised at this. That's a large effect! I rechecked my old spreadsheet, as one does, and it all seems to check out. Fundamentally, what happens is that the car spends more time with the higher aero drag than it would if just traveling at the higher speeds. Energy consumption is energy used over distance (Wh/mi). In this example, the car spends 5.3% longer traveling at 75 mph vs 79 mph to go the same distance.

For those curious, a 10 mph headwind while driving at 75mph increases energy consumption by about 29% and a 10 mph tailwind decreases it by 22%. If you do a round-trip test by driving into a 10 mph headwind, then return with the tailwind, just averaging those results introduces a 3.5% error [(1.29+0.78)/2].
""

There are so many variables it is very difficult to figure out expected efficiency - especially at freeway speeds. And temperature seems to make a surprisingly large difference even if the HVAC is off...

1) Yes, power to overcome drag goes up as the cube of velocity. But sadly in the case of wind we don't get to ""lose"" one of those powers (and just get the standard ""Wh/mi increases proportional to square of velocity"" by reducing the time over which the power is exerted). (As your numbers show, energy to complete a standard trip does not simply scale by the square of the velocity, of course, since aero loss is not the only thing...since there are some losses that are fixed per unit distance, and others that are fixed per unit time (and go down the faster you go).)

2) Yes, round trip with wind doesn't ""cancel out"", due to the nonlinear nature of the losses. For the same reason, average speed on a trip is often misleading - especially if most of what pulls down the average is very slow travel (typical for freeway runs with brief surface streets before/after). In these cases, it's hard to calculate the effective speed to use, but generally you should quote your typical freeway speed.

3) If you want to see historical wind data for a particular trip, you can visit: NWS Weather & Hazards (This is centered on San Diego (SGX), but you can pan around or use your local weather service station code.) Click on a weather station and you can easily see 3 & 7-day historical data.

Anyway, here is data from a 26-mile round trip generally north/south - though about 25% was into/out of the wind, from above website, winds were about 2-4mph from the west - was hard to notice the impact since the outboundwhich was partially east was also slightly downhill)

Round trip (as close as exits allowed), P3D+, stock:
Average speed 71mph
Freeway speeds (vast majority of time): 75-80mph
Distance: 26.3 miles
Time: 22 minutes
Net elevation change: -13 feet (from Gaia GPS: +742 ft, -755 ft) (No hills came close to regen so minimal impact)
Wh/mi: 275Wh/mi
HVAC basically off (some brief fan ONLY use)
Temp: 65-70 degrees, sunny
So I think this aligns pretty well with a true average speed of 75mph (with peak speeds more consistently at 75-80mph) ending up around 295Wh/mi (it might end up being a bit lower). It was a short segment but I did start the segment after the car had ""warmed up"" - so if there is any significant starting overhead that would have been excluded.",,0,0,0,0

Here is the rough cash flow statement. I've only done the Operating cash flow & Capex part - not the financing part. The delivery numbers used are optimistic (as shown here) at 92k, 105k, 117k for the next 3 quarters.

I've also included the excel file that has p&l and the cash flow for you to play with.

I don't see much I'd change. Leasing almost 4k Model 3s will be a ~175m hit to cash flow, but S/X lease fleet will shrink a little and partially offset that. If they partially unwind the wave inventory should grow some. AP/accrued would also grow if they build the ~80k Model 3s needed to deliver 75k and also unwind some.

I don't see 500m of capex. I know they guided 2.0-2.5b for the year, but they've been far below guidance for several quarters and I don't see any signs they've ramped back up.

I've seen this mentioned a few times the last couple of days, and I feel like I need to respond.

Everyone looking for the most amazing inventory deals, please realize that no matter how they are found, they last only minutes before someone sees it and buys the car.

Besides EV-CPO and the other sites, there are A LOT of independent people constantly searching Tesla's site on their own for a good deal, either manually by plugging in zip codes, or macros, or their own API scripts (I've helped a few people do this for their own use). So the actual window of time these deals are available to be captured by any website is very, very short. And it's not possible to scan every zip code and every car on Tesla's site every four minutes to capture every possible deal or listed car (well, you can try, but Tesla will actively ban your IP address if you try too hard).

I'm sure there are lots of amazing deals that EV-CPO caught based solely on good timing, that other sites didn't catch before they were snatched up and delisted. Will EV-CPO miss a few good deals because they're listed so briefly? Sure. But so will every other site out there. For the inventory cars with the biggest discounts, all the sites use the same API and access methods, so really, it just gets down to which site (or other independent users or their scripts) found the good deals first.

And I know there have been lots of amazing deals people have gotten that no site had time to catch.

If California was able to get a Boring Company tunnel from San Jose to Los Angeles, how would you deal with the charging? Since it will not be enough to travel 350+ miles?

Is there a way to get power inside the tunnel while in it?

What about cars like M3 SR at 220 miles on a full charge?

Would it have mini stops every 100 miles so one can charge?
""

You'd be guaranteed no cross winds, no rain, no snow. So the miles per kWh or wh per mile would be easily calculated.

Slope would be minimized so no huge upslope or downslope.

Curves and turns would be mostly eliminated other than exits and maybe one or two mid course curves to hit the next waypoint.

If your top speed precludes going non stop you'd just take an exit to a supercharger part way through. Supercharge for 10-15 minutes and get back in the tunnel.

Your average speed would still be higher than taking surface roads.

But then again enough years will pass between the situation described and now that a 200 mile range car won't be in that tunnel and the car that you will take will be fully self driving so you could take a nap in the tunnel assuming you are still using cars that far in the future (I don't know how old you are)",,0,0,0,0

I ordered an SR+, Black/Black with 18-inch aeros on May 16th. Will be interesting to see how much extra backlog there was from the 5th to the 16th (I'm guessing it could be ~1,000 cars), and how quickly they can deliver the ones that were ordered during that period. In other words, I'm betting they can take orders faster than they can deliver cars.

From what I can gather reading these forums and checking the order tracking spreadsheet, no one from YVR who ordered my basic configuration after May 7th has received a VIN. Based on your timeline, I'm hoping for a VIN by this Friday with delivery by the middle of June, but time will tell.

I'm definitely all for this and think it is about time Tesla implemented something like this at busy stations.

The time it takes to SuperCharge past 80% is inefficient compared to other cars that are waiting with a lower state of charge.

personally I doubt most of us will be negatively effected. the problem is effected means different things to different people.



this +1000

tesla will be limiting charging to 80% at stations where there is probably an alternative station pithing 20, 30, or 40 miles.

so you have the option of going there and topping up. the issue here becomes a necessary detour, or somewhat prolonged road trip b/c charging to 100% avoids a second SC stop or devotion to second SCer. so yes. even though you can still make it to your destination, there is an extra inconvenience, that some of is feel we are entitled to be exempt from.

I personally disagree with this idea of entitlement. we all need to learn to share what is in effect a limited, and as it turns out -- occasionally scarce -- resource.



yes, you need a buffer but this is probably not going to be happening in places where the nearest SCer is 150 or 200 miles away so I think you are safe. as I wrote above, it might happen in places where there are SCers 50 miles away, but the 80% restriction might be an inconvenience at best.



Wow.

What makes your driving habits any more valid or correct than mine? are you, like, the Emperor of the Tesla Super Charger highway that your driving habits can just trample on the rest of us peasants without the slightest consideration?

i'm only being faintly facetious here.

do you hear the entitlement in your statement? there are thousands of Teslas on the road. and a limited number of chargers with limited capacity. you can have unlimited free for like supercharging to abuse all you want. this is your right -- actually I personally don't believe that, but i'll play along b/c it sounds like you think you own the whole world and we are your humble servants. Thing is -- come back at 3 in the morning when your favorite SCer site is not 6 cars deep waiting for a charge and pull as many free electrons from the SCer as your callous little heart can stand.

in the meantime, I hope the rest of us will be happy to act in a more neighborly manner and realize that other drivers have similar needs to the SCer network and sitting around for 30 minutes going from 95 to 100% SOC is neither good use of your own time, nor good use of Teala's SCer network.

I too wish that we could wave our magic wands and increase SCer charge rates and capacity but the technology is just not there yet. in 50 years perhaps we will have be able to replenish 500 miles in 5 minutes so all of the cry babies who miss their ICE road trip habits can, you know, shave a few extra minutes off their 8 hour road trip while risking falling asleep at the wheel and putting themselves and god-knows-who else in danger.

I have heard amazing things about the Toyota Camry. very reliable. and you can replenish it's full full storage capacity in roughly 5 minutes from empty today!! Want something a little more Luxe? Toyota's Lexus line makes lovely vehicles. the Germans IIRC also have this technology and some American brands as well, if you would rather go the patriotic route.. and, best of all, you never have to be told to move your stinking Tesla so one of us peasants might get a charge.

3693675,Neurio vs. Tesla,Frankman60,2019-05-26 14:03:00,"I have had a Neurio energy monitoring system in place for 5 years that monitors my PV system and house energy use. It has worked great and the Neurio monthly calculated electricity bill is pretty accurate compared to my utility company bill. Now that I have Powerwalls in place, I am able to compare the Tesla app energy usage to the Neurio app energy usage. I realize that Tesla also uses Neurio for its app but to differentiate between the two systems I will refer to them as Neurio (legacy system ) and Tesla (new Powerwall monitoring using the Tesla app). For people that also have a Neurio monitoring system in place, and plan to get Powerwalls, this is what I have noticed:

1. When solar energy is going directly into the battery as shown in the Tesla app, this energy is being counted at energy usage in the Neurio app. So for example, if the solar is producing 2 kWs going into the PWs, and the house is using 3 kWs from the grid, Neurio reports 5 kWs being used. Neurio has no category for stored energy such as a Powerwall. This at first didn’t seem accurate to me, until I noticed how Neurio counts energy flowing FROM the PWs to the house. It doesn’t count it at all. During the Peak Period PWs provide all of the house electricity. Neurio reports zero usage. I think in theory this is OK but please comment if you think this is not right.

2. I noticed that when solar and PWs are removed from the equation, that Neurio and Tesla report different measurements of the energy flow. For example, my EVs were charging after midnight and I observed the Tesla app reporting grid to house use of 11.9 kWs. I then checked Neurio and it showed 13.2 kWs. I don’t know why this would be the case. I looked at the Tesla and Neurio CTs installed inside the electrical panel and they are side by side on the same wires. By the way, the Tesla CTs are thinner than the Neurio CTs so it is easy to differentiate them.

3. I also compared the daily summary of kWhs between the two apps. The Neurio reported kWh usage is about 10 to 13 percent higher than what is reported in the Tesla app. This is consistent with what I mentioned in 2 above.

4. Solar production measurements between the two systems for the day is within 1 percent.

I understand that there is a loss of energy when it flows to/from the Powerwalls and am wondering where that loss would be captured? I am using Time Based Control Cost Savings and have only configured Peak (5 hours) and Off Peak (19 hours) with no Shoulder period.

If anyone has any ideas of why the two systems would be off by 10-13 percent, please comment.",,0,0,0,0

↑

Yep, and that's why there are differing definitions of ""feature complete"". And as you point out it depends on development methodology as well. So in the end we really don't know what it means to be feature complete for FSD.
""

I think some folks may be overthinking what ""feature complete"" means. The problem is that some folks are coming up with their own list of features that they think FSD needs in order to be feature complete. But we don't need to do that and we don't need to play guessing games either. Tesla has given us a set of features on the website. I think we can reasonably assume that those features listed on the website are what Tesla means by ""feature complete"".

First, we have the list of FSD features on the order page:

Full Self-Driving Capability

Navigate on Autopilot: automatic driving from highway on-ramp to off-ramp including interchanges and overtaking slower cars.
Auto Lane Change: automatic lane changes while driving on the highway.
Autopark: both parallel and perpendicular spaces.
Summon: your parked car will come find you anywhere in a parking lot. Really.
Coming later this year:

Recognize and respond to traffic lights and stop signs.
Automatic driving on city streets.
We can infer from the divider ""coming later this year"" that whatever is listed before it, is considered COMPLETED and whatever is listed after it, is still PENDING. So Tesla considers the first 4 features to already be COMPLETED since they have been delivered to customers. (Note: Summon as described above is not COMPLETED yet but is expected to be released very soon). This does not mean that the features won't still improve, it just means that they have been delivered to customers. Tesla will undoubtedly continue to improve NOA, Auto lane changes, Autopark and Summon in future updates.

So Tesla considers the following FSD features to still be PENDING:

Recognize and respond to traffic lights and stop signs.
Automatic driving on city streets.
Once these two features are delivered to customers, Tesla will consider FSD to be ""feature complete"". That is why Elon says that ""feature complete"" should happen later this year and why the website says ""coming later this year"". Elon and Tesla feel like the FSD progress in good enough shape that they can deliver these last two features to customers by the end of this year. And based on what we saw on Autonomy Investor Day, I think that is realistic. But what people need to understand is that ""feature complete"" DOES NOT mean a finished product or a perfect product. It is simply a set of basic or primary must-have features. Put differently, ""Feature Complete"" is what Tesla considers to be the bare minimum. Once Tesla delivers ""feature complete"", Tesla will then move on to the next job of adding secondary features and improving existing features to get it up to L4/5. Essentially, Tesla's strategy is to deliver the foundational features first and then build on that. Think of the house analogy: ""Feature complete"" is the foundation. You lay the foundation first which then allows you to build the rest of the house on top of it. So the features on the website, NOA, Auto Lane Change, Auto Park, Summon, Recognizing and responding to traffic lights and stop signs, and automatic city driving on city streets, are Tesla's foundation for FSD.

Second, on the Autopilot page, Tesla gives a bit more detail on FSD:

""All you will need to do is get in and tell your car where to go. If you don’t say anything, the car will look at your calendar and take you there as the assumed destination or just home if nothing is on the calendar. Your Tesla will figure out the optimal route, navigate urban streets (even without lane markings), manage complex intersections with traffic lights, stop signs and roundabouts, and handle densely packed freeways with cars moving at high speed. When you arrive at your destination, simply step out at the entrance and your car will enter park seek mode, automatically search for a spot and park itself. A tap on your phone summons it back to you.""

From this description, we can infer a bit more information on what ""Automatic driving on city streets"" will involve:

Navigate urban streets (even without lane markings)
Manage complex intersections with traffic lights, stop signs and roundabouts
In conclusion, based on the information on the Tesla website, I think we can reasonably expect that Tesla needs to deliver the following features to reach ""feature complete"":

Smart Summon: your parked car will come find you anywhere in a parking lot. Really.
Recognize and respond to traffic lights and stop signs.
Navigate urban streets (even without lane markings)
Manage complex intersections with traffic lights, stop signs and roundabouts
Again, this does not mean that the features will be perfect, it just means that they will deliver these features to the customer in a software update. After ""feature complete"", Tesla will continue to improve and expand on these features in order to finish FSD.",,1,0,0,0

""

If you have ever driven on the German Autobahn you'll understand that strict passing rules are crucial for safety. Given the often large speed differentials, it would be complete chaos if passing on the right was allowed. The downside is that there is often road rage if someone wants to pass and the left lane is blocked by a slower car (then aggressive drivers sometimes start tailgating and angrily blinking or even flashing their highbeams).

So far, Tesla has tracked the global growth curve quite closely. Production problems may have Tesla low one year, and then they catch up the next year. Make no mistake, Tesla is still strictly production limited.

We now know something about how the adoption curve will look after it reaches 50% market share, thanks to Norway essentially reaching 50% last year. It keeps going exponentially the next year, right up to 75%. In 2020 we will probably find out how the rest of the back half of the adoption curve looks in Norway -- I doubt it will go up to 112.5% market share, so it'll be a very interesting number to look at.

Have you contacted your local sc to see what they say about replacing your screen? I would start there before jumping to conclusions or taking what other people say as gospel.
""

As mentioned in the original post (which I guess might have been a little too long): I have had nothing but fantastic customer service from Tesla in the past. I have contacted them regarding the yellow screen several times. I continue to have nothing but the highest regard for the people at my SC. 

What I heard from my SC was that a permanent fix is still being explored by engineering. The SC gave me no ETA for a repair. This is a worrisome situation since Tesla is selling brand new cars right now. Are they selling those cars with a known defect? If not, are they withholding a permanent fix for existing customers? I feel these are important questions.

Part of the reason I originally posted this information was to refute some of the rumors such as a software fix, which obviously would not work since the yellow is reflective and therefore both blocks the light from the screen and reflects sunlight hitting it.

Another reason for this post was to show that this yellowing can worsen into more than a cosmetic issue.

I am a staunch Tesla supporter and want them to succeed. I've driven electric since 2013 and will never go back. In my opinion, excellent customer service is just as important as manufacturing an excellent car. Relegating customers to stare at their yellowing screens for months or years on end, is not, in my opinion, the kind of customer service that will encourage future sales or glowing recommendations",,0,0,0,0

Reality is that Tesla paint jobs are not flawless show car quality.

Tesla makes over 5,000 of these every week. If you look hard enough you will be able to find flaws. I have seen published check lists where they advocate a buyer go over every inch of their car with high intensity lighting, plus use sophisticated paint thickness measurements to make sure their paint is even over every panel. Tough standard for any volume manufacturer to attain.

Problem is that even if Tesla repaints the problem areas, a vigilant inspector will still be able to locate flaws. For the most picky, nothing will ever be good enough.

Balancing this all out, their have also been many reports form new owners stating that to them their new Tesla has been delivered in a flawless condition. Shows that it can be done, but perhaps not on every single car at delivery.

Some high end cars may have higher quality paint, but even on those they are not always show quality.
If your car can be fixed for $200-$300 at a detail shop to get ready for an aftermarket ceramic coating, that is pretty normal for most production vehicles. Most all detailers will go over their cars with a fine tooth comb to prepare them for the very expensive ceramic coatings. They typically use powerful buffers all over the cars to smooth down the production finishes.

Some small fish eye, orange peal or other imperfections are pretty normal for high production paint booths. Show car finishes are very expensive and time consuming.

Understand Tesla not wanting to pay for this detailing and prep work for an unauthorized shop. (also understand that the owner also would like to find someone else to pick up their tab for the prep).

On the other hand, if a new owner sees significant scratches, large paint runs or obvious signs of a defective paint job, it would be the obligation of Tesla to make it right.

I gave up on the mileage a long time ago. Yes my 100% would hit 310 on my AWD when I used miles. Now I only use % since the miles was never accurate given my high speed limit roads (70-80MPH depending on the road). Now I just do the math in my head where 10% is 25 miles. Yes if the weather is nice it usually exceeds this, but it is all I count on. If I am going to drive 100 miles I need more than 40%, preferably 45% to get to the next charger.

I only count on my car to go 250 miles. On the coldest days in the winter it was a challenge to go 250 (had to drive 55 on 75 MPH roads). But, when it is over about 45 degrees it is easy to go 25 miles for 10%.

If my watts per mile is averaging over 300 I will slow down to get it to 300. This was really only an issue in Dec-Feb around here where it gets cold. The other day I did a 90 mile trip and it was only 250 watts, at 75 MPH. But, I will just stick to 25 miles per 10% to be safe.",,0,0,0,0

I think the difference is - for people like us in US - it is not that much of an emotional issue. We can look at it more like an outside independent observer.

Last time they had a vote on Quebec independence they lost by 1% - some 50,000 votes. These things are not always rational - and big events like Brexit will have unintended consequences. Just like Iraq war did. The British leaving India did. It is just inevitable. Ofcourse it is difficult to figure out with certainty what the consequences are - but the likely ones are some kind of trouble in N.I. and Scottish independence. Then there are things like disintegration of Tories & Labor party.

About Texas leaving US - yes, it can happen. But only when something really weird happens in US that Texans just hate. BTW, remember Texas is turning Democratic and some recent polls show both Biden & Sanders beating Trump there. So, the chances of Texas leaving US is receding. OTOH, what will happen if Supreme Court bans abortion or if there is 2000 type recount fiasco that Supreme Court decides in favor of Trump - will the blue states leave US ?
""

We have several steps before that. I can guarantee that if one of those extreme coup-type scenarios happens, the blue states will start to simply refuse to recognize the authority of the unelected federal government. 

However, I think those extreme scenarios are becoming less and less likely since Trump has decided to deliberately pick fights with John Roberts (!!!) reducing the chances that Roberts will vote to support him, and even Republican election commissions are starting to get disturbed by the election thefts and ordering reruns of stolen elections.

But on the topic of state reactions to the extreme scenarios of really abusive and outrageous federal behavior:

We've already had a second ""nullification crisis"" -- over drug laws -- and almost nobody noticed, and the *states won*, with the federal government effectively losing power.

The Tesla (and I think it may be all cars) are designed that if the brake and the accelerator pedals are both pressed, the brake takes precedence. So if she really had one foot on the brake and the other foot on the accelerator, the car would have stopped moving forward.

On a slight hill that allowed me to give some accelerator input but still move slowly, I did two experiments

1) with no pedal input, car in drive, no seatbelt, lifted my bottom off the seat. Car immediately goes into park

2). With accelerator pedal input, no seatbelt, lifted my bottom off the seat. Car remains in drive. 

I was not expecting this, but guess the story could be consistent with a foot or floor mat pressing on the accelerator when the driver exited the car.
""

The car will only shift into Park if your butt lifts off the seat at a slow rate of travel. Above a predetermined speed (I can’t remember what the speed is), the car will NOT shift into Park if your bottom is lifted off the seat. It has nothing to do with whether you are depressing the accelerator. Try it, drive to say 30mph and lift your bottom off the seat while your foot is NOT depressing the accelerator pedal. The car will stay in Drive.

In a non-related manner, if you are driving and accidentally press the Park button on the steering wheel stark, the car will not shift into Park. To shift into Park while the car is in motion you have to depress the Park button and hold it depressed.",,0,0,0,0

SpaceX will warn you that they will never pay a dividend, that they are quite possibly never going public, and will explain that you can sell part of your stock back TO THEM every six months at prices of THEIR choosing, though they can discontinue this at any time they like; and you can make a private sale but they have right of first refusal to buy your stock at the price of their choice.

First, get the serial number for your inverter and ask SolarEdge to confirm they were entered on your account correctly. Otherwise, it's probably a network issue.

This can happen when the networking in the inverter isn't set up properly or when the gateway is too far away. In my case, one of the inverters wasn't configured for Zigbee so I was only seeing production from half of my panels in the app. Tesla automatically adjusts numbers that can't possibly be correct, so having the SolarEdge app was very helpful at diagnosing the problem.

As long as you say it's a problem with the solarSola app, Tesla is likely to ignore you so I'd suggest focusing on a problem that Tesla actually supports. Check the lights on your gateway to see if it says ""no server"" or ""no internet"" and call about that instead. If everything's fine on that side, compare the output displayed on your inverter to what you're seeing in the app. If they don't match after adjusting for a little bit of delay (it's only 5 or 10 seconds for me in the Tesla app... It can be 5 to 10 minutes in SolarEdge), call them about that. Last, check for your historical data in the SolarCity app. You can scroll through the menus on your inverter to get numbers for comparisons. My historical data in the SolarCity app matches SolarEdge perfectly. When there are issues and the inverters haven't uploaded data, both apps remain in lockstep. If they're not pulling data from the same source, they're both getting the same data at the same time.

Basically, if SolarEdge isn't getting your data then there's a good chance that something controlled by Tesla is displaying wrong too. Find it, have Tesla will fix it and the SolarEdge issue will be miraculously resolved.",,0,0,0,0

The Tesla (and I think it may be all cars) are designed that if the brake and the accelerator pedals are both pressed, the brake takes precedence. So if she really had one foot on the brake and the other foot on the accelerator, the car would have stopped moving forward.



The car will only shift into Park if your butt lifts off the seat at a slow rate of travel. Above a predetermined speed (I can’t remember what the speed is), the car will NOT shift into Park if your bottom is lifted off the seat. It has nothing to do with whether you are depressing the accelerator. Try it, drive to say 30mph and lift your bottom off the seat while your foot is NOT depressing the accelerator pedal. The car will stay in Drive.

In a non-related manner, if you are driving and accidentally press the Park button on the steering wheel stark, the car will not shift into Park. To shift into Park while the car is in motion you have to depress the Park button and hold it depressed.
""

Seems there was a rather long thread recently discussing what the difference was between PARK and holding the park button in to set emergency brake. And if there any difference between the two. 
Not sure if anyone figured it out conclusively. Possibly more holding force with the emergency brake version? 
But regardless it allows a way to put the emergency brake on if you were in a runaway car I guess with failed brakes.

LDA is fine, especiall in the ""warning"" setting. I don't mind if the steering wheel vibrates when it thinks I'm going out of a lane.

I don't see much I'd change. Leasing almost 4k Model 3s will be a ~175m hit to cash flow, but S/X lease fleet will shrink a little and partially offset that.

Even with unwinding of the wave I expect Model 3 inventory to grow and s+x to come down. So, given the extremely high inventory build up in Q1 ($800M), we'll actually see the inventory level go down.

The next supercharger was more than 130 miles away in Tampa. So it’s not the case that they only limit the charge at locations that are near to other superchargers.

Fortunately, the model 3 is more efficient than my P85 and this limit is not a serious problem for her car. But in my car it could possibly be a problem.

She did try to see if she could over-ride Tesla’s setting, and she was able to increase the limit beyond 80%. The trip route was set into the navigation. I don’t know whether you could over-ride the 80% limit if you are not using the trip navigation.",,0,0,0,0

This Tesla issue is on a different level to the example I'm about to give. In many ICE cars they have the engine stop/start function where it shuts the engine off once you are idle for a few seconds and then automatically restarts when you let the foot off the brake. It is super annoying but it is a way the OEM's try to reduce emissions and fuel consumption.
In some vehicles there is a physical button to turn it off, in others it might be in a menu in the infotainment system and finally some vehicles this cannot be disabled at all. So the idea of an intrusive option being ultimately controlled by the OEM isn't new, problem is the example I gave is just an annoyance you have to deal with, this new Emergency Lane thing is outright dangerous from what people are saying and should have from day one been 'opt in' and remember your last setting.
Everyone with this option really needs to make some noise about this to Tesla and have them change it to opt in and make the setting stick.
""

The way I look at it, this is out of character for Tesla's overall deign philosophy of AP. I think that's why it strikes me as so off. Most other places the design is ""human has the veto to override the car's choices"", this appears to be the computer overriding the direct human steering wheel input. I say ""appears"" because that's what it has felt like, in the two times now I've seen it. I wasn't expecting this at all the first time, so had a hard time being confident. The second time, after I forgot to disable ELDA after putting the car in drive (d'oh), I was a lot more sure it was messing with the steering. But I'm not sure exactly what it was doing, and how much.

I actually have seen this to an extent in other vehicles that have ""lane keep assist"" type features. And I always turn them off. Part of it is because if they kick in at he exact moment I decided I'm too far over, then you get a multiple effect leading to overcorrection. The other part is at times I'll have a damn good reason for being at the edge/over the lane. Avoiding a hazard or whatever. The last thing I want to be doing at that point is trying to also compensate for what the vehicle might also be doing, because I'm probably in something of a tense spot already and have need of a good deal of precision aiming the vehicle.",,0,0,0,0

In a way I agree, but when thinking of manufacturing difficulty and complexity and value, it's the opposite. ICE OEMs outsource most everything except engines and transmissions since those components comprise the core of an ICE, are the most expensive, comprise the most guarded value, where the OEM focuses innovation, research, etc. While electric motors are important, battery systems comprise the bulk of the value and focus of innovation for an EV and are therefore a lot more valuable than a fuel tank or the fuel equivalent of the ICE.

And temperature seems to make a surprisingly large difference even if the HVAC is off...
""

I'd be curious to hear what you consider a large difference. Assuming HVAC is off, temperature primarily affects atmospheric pressure along with tire compound temperature and tire pressure. Looking only at atmospheric pressure (ignoring HVAC, tires and assuming a warm battery and no BMS losses), my Model 3 energy consumption model drops by 1% per 9F (5C) rise in temperature. For example, consumption and range would be 3% better in 90F temps verses 63F. 

In your case, you might see 273 to 281Wh/mi over that same 63 to 90F range. (Again this assumes a warm battery, no precipitation or wet roads, no tire temp effects, no HVAC)

If you want to allow cars to drive themselves in these tunnels (as opposed to using sledges like Boring originally planned), you'll have to think hard about a way to evacuate cars that have a flat tire or other damage, otherwise traffic in a busy, long tunnel will probably rarely flow (not to mention potential safety issues).

No particular expertise in this area but in physics and many fields measurement often opens up new vistas. Sometimes I get the impression we ""discover"" new particles only when we develop a new machine capable of detecting/creating them. Likewise, an art critic once said people never recognized how beautiful mountains were until artists started painting them.

Today through measurement of ""clicks"" we can determine audience reaction and thus tailor the message. Were Mcluhan alive he would probably say ""measurement is the message."" Measuring popularity of news by how many unsold newspapers were returned was not a fine-tuned estimate.

Haven't been in a classroom as a teacher for 11 years so out of touch with contemporary youth. I hope you are right to have confidence in them. Their disdain for Trump and all climate change deniers is understandable and that will grow like tornadoes in the moment—a physics first principle.

In old age it is difficult realizing how much of what I know is just a restating of the obvious, my measurement disability. Too bad Marx so fundamentally misunderstood Hegel. That old one once said ""The real is rational, and the rational is real."" On this plane, Hegel, like Buddha, is a monist. The mind/body problem, the distinction of self from others, the notion of consciousness separate from an external world, are all false distinctions, illusions if you will. How frustrating it is for Trump and other narcissists to deal with others who also create their own reality.

If the stakes weren't so high it would be merely amusing to see how skillfully grandma Pilosi winds, and rewinds, Trump's tightly wound clock. (Almost dropped the ""l"".)

The downside is that Millennials often distrust all information, even factual information. We've always had older generations complaining about younger generations, but the gap between the Boomer and Xers and Millennials might be the deepest in history. The late Xers (the Oregon trail generation) are more like the Millennials than early Xers, but Millennials grew up in an environment very different from previous generations. For at least the urban and suburban Millennials, computing devices have been ubiquitous their entire lives. 

Back in the mid-90s I had a friend with a toddler and she was amazed that before he was 3 he could identify the CD for the game he liked, load it in the computer and get the game started. For the early Xers and older, the internet came along when we were adults, but most people under 40 today grew up with it (or it was there in their formative years at least).

The gap between rural and urban/suburban youth has been growing as much as it did when electricity was only available in cities. In rural areas the wealthier people can get satellite broadband, but a lot of people are stuck with very poor internet service. Rural youth already have a different experience growing up, but that widens the gap.

Most people don't realize this, but Trump's primary line of business was theft, specifically hiring contractors to do work and then not paying them.

Holding Trump accountable is a pocketbook issue

It is rather astounding that he did worse than an index fund when he has been constantly stealing money.

It is imperative that he go to prison; most of his crimes were commuted in New York City, so Sing Sing would be appropriate. It shows how corrupt the US has gotten that he has not been criminally charged by the NY DA yet.
""

Prosecutors tend to move slowly, especially in high profile cases against people with legions of lawyers. The NY supreme court ruled that a sitting president can be indicted and the new AG does not like Trump. She may still be building her case. She knows that Trump is going to fight any charges tooth and nail so she needs to be sure she has an air tight case before going after him.

Since the House has opened a number of investigations into Trump, the size of Trump's legal team has exploded, but where is the money to pay these lawyers coming from? Knowing Trump, it's probably stolen from some fund like his re-election campaign. Few are even talking about it.

I saw something a year or so back from one of his partners in the casino business. The casinos were doing OK until Trump started siphoning off money and there was a short downturn in business.

The car arrow icon was huge relative to the streets in many intersections and with the angled perspective it was quite unclear what road to take.

Could not agree more, I just got Dragy and its amazing. I'm still getting through testing my P85D to see what it will do, then I'll do the same to the P100DL. First run was for the P85D 11.85 at 77% SOC no launch mode or max battery. Second run was last night and I made sure to run it at the same state of charge (77% no luanch mode insane mode), it did 11.77. It pulled power on the 60-130 run right after, so I probably shouldn't have even posted that on Dragy.

The issue with bullet trains is the insane amount of track maintenance required.

I have to say I am about done with this process. And by that I don't mean I almost have a car I mean Tesla has done such a poor job from beginning to end im about ready to turn around and walk. I called today because the car has been delivered since Tuesday and haven't heard a thing (besides me calling and asking on my own). Asked about the car, they are like, uhhhh yahhh so we are probably looking at Tuesday if we dont have to replace anything. WTF?!?!? What do you mean IF? You've had the car since Tuesday evening and you have yet to decide if anything needs to be replaced? They say ""We have a long list to go through..."" BS...I think they haven't even touched the car at this point. Asked for a loaner since technically I paid for this car on the ninth and have yet to be able to drive a Tesla...Nope no loaner for you. Tuesday if you're lucky, maybe longer. Called the 800 number to ask wtf? Why does the SC no longer do Saturday delivery as of this week and yet I was told this was going to happen? Why isn't my car ready?

In short you are at Teslas mercy, they have no escalation paths so if the service centers tells you to go suck lemons that's what you have to do. All you can do is take your money and run. I HATE having to deal with this BS and this is exactly why I bought from Carvana last time. This will probably be the last Tesla direct purchase I ever do.

So yah, Tuesday, be on the lookout and I'll let you know how THAT goes...

Glad that you are safe.

Simple explaination is that your front tires, with plenty of tread held the road as you would expect, while your rear wheels with little tread hydroplaned and lost traction.

If you simply feathered your throttle, you migh have got away with it, but if you lifted, the tires with no traction would again have hydroplaned and set you up for a spin.

Spin caused by mismatched tire, plus driving at excessive speed for conditions.

Yes, either of those are possibilities, but I am not sufficiently confident in my skills with high-voltage / high power wiring to do this myself. Also, at $500, the wall charger is about $100 more expensive than the OpenEVSE kit. While the wall charger can charge at 48A vs. the OpenEVSE kit that charges at 40A, neither the currently installed 50A breaker nor the 14-50 socket are rated for more than 40A continuous. Thus, the higher potential charge rate of the wall charger would require additional expenditures for installing a new 60A breaker and the associated wiring. Based on all this, the OpenEVSE kit seems like the simplest and most cost effective solution.

You could expect ~230 miles from a charge on a single long highway drive in ideal conditions, with nice warm weather, no wind, and sticking to the speed limit.

3694045,DA told me that no charging adapters are included with purchase,SMAlset,2019-05-26 17:11:00,"Tesla can never make everyone happy at the same time. 

They did reduce the cost of the Gen 2 Mobile Connector Bundle kit when they changed it up and excluded the majority of the adapters that use to come with the kit. People were objecting to the higher cost of the kit and the fact that they rarely used most of the adapters that were included. So looks like they figured the NEMA 5-15 adapter (for standard 120 AC outlet) would be the universal one to include. People who were setting up their garages to charge either put in a HPWC (no need for an adapter) or installed a NEMA 14-50 240v outlet (in which case they would buy the J-1772 adapter which has always run close to $100). Or some people have washer/dryers in their garages (at least in California I've seen) and they could run their charging off an outlet for that (which would require a different adapter). We charge at home and installed a NEMA 14-50 outlet but purchased the corded mobile connector instead of the HPWC (both of which run about $500 but are more or less permanent sources in the garage). Not everyone's charging situation is the same. Some will only use Superchargers or Urban chargers if they don't have home charging solutions. Some may never use a J-1772 (the most expensive adapter). I don't think they made a bad choice in doing this especially with the Model 3 being priced lower than the Model S/X and needing to keep margins at a good level for themselves. 

As for the phone connectors, another situation where they had been supplying a solution (two of them but one for an iPhones and one for Android phones) and people not wanting one of each. Some did, but from my experience at the delivery center most people wanted two fo the same type. I can see where not providing a solution and letting people buy what they wanted made sense for them and they thought the majority of their customers. 

I'm sure when you bought your car before and received the complement of adapters and the two different phone cords, the cost of them were factored into the overall car pricing.",,0,0,0,0

Thanks for the comment, very informative and useful, i'm happy that you are satisfy with your purchase and going after the others that doesn't have the same experience as you. 

When I walk up to the dealership in Vancouver, they are clearly stated that car buying experience for Tesla is totally different, no negotiation and no discounts, just order it online and everyone got the same price, make it sounds like apple stores. Guess what? seems like that is not the case and they are just typical dealership to push sales. If I do come at the right time they indeed will offers discount to inventory model. 

If Tesla didn't specifically given the impression that their car buying experience is different than the old fashioned dealership I wouldn't be that upset.

Tesla doesn't finance, it's banks that Tesla has arranged with that does it.

For someone getting a new job, possibly with student debt, little to no credit history, and honestly a salary that doesn't probably even justify an expenditure that high, I doubt it.

I'd also suggest that you need to reset your expectations a little. You are about to have a lot more expenditures than you ever imagined and you need to look a a LOT less expensive car.

But if you don't agree with me, then since I'd assume that you've got at least $20k saved now for a car (and other money for other savings) then you should easily be able to set aside $2k a month for the next two years. Then you can feel free to get a car.",,0,0,0,0

the car can be locked on the screen or on the app.
""

A lock button on the screen does absolutely no good for locking the car when you leave. And it is a frigging pain in the arse to have to pull out my phone, launch the app, scroll to the appropriate screen, and then press the lock button. Consider what happens with the Prius, a car that does lock/unlock right: You never have to take the fob or anything else out of your pocket. You get out of the car, close the door, and press the button to lock it. Return to the car, and lightly touch the inside of the door handle, and it unlocks.

Now consider the Model 3: You get out of the car, walk away, and about the time you are out of earshot, it locks and makes a quiet beep. If you forgot that your BT is off, it doesn't lock, and you don't know it because half the time you don't hear it lock anyway. Your alternative is to fruckle around with your phone to lock the car, or pull out the key card to lock it.

Today I nearly had a disaster: It was my day for kayaking again. (On canoeing days I walk to the club, but on kayaking days I drive to wherever we've decided to launch.) I got there, and turned off BT because I want to leave the phone in the car rather than taking it out on the water. I grabbed some of my gear and shut the door and carried my handful of gear over to the kayaks.

But with the BT off, the car thought it had gone out of range, and when I shut the door, it locked. I had not grabbed the otter box with the kay card, so now the car was locked with both phone and card inside! (The Prius won't lock with the key fob inside! The Model 3, as I learned, will happily lock you out.) The spare key card was back at home, half an hour's drive away. I was going to lose an hour on the water and have to beg a ride home and back. I could not even go kayaking first because my hat and dark glasses (both essential for spending several hours out on the water, in the tropical sun) were locked in the car.

Then I had a brain wave: And finally I come to one good thing about the phone as key!: I got my friend to download the Tesla app on his phone, logged in to my Tesla account, and told the app to unlock the car. It asked me ""Are you sure you want to remotely unlock the car?"" I answered Yes, and voila! my car unlocked. Then I had my friend delete the app from his phone. We only lost about 3 minutes, instead of an hour.

(When I had the Prius, I put the fob in the otter box, put that in a dry bag, and brought it with me on the water. But I don't want to risk taking the phone out on the water, though some folks do.)",,0,0,0,0

Europe EV Sales: Renault Zoe Wins In December, Nissan LEAF Takes 2018 Title | CleanTechnica
Looks like ZOE sold around 40,000 last year and is on the increase, say 50,000 in 2020. That will be worth 100,000 cars in 2020 due to Supercredits. Not bad. Also looks like Renault sold about 1,000,000 cars in Europe in 2018, but that has been up and down, so let’s leave that the same for 2020. FCA about the same.

3. Drivetrain - I assume this is the recent Raven upgrade ... or is there another drivetrain change coming?

I would (if you don't care about range) seriously consider an Audi e-tron in your case. Or perhaps a VW ID.3, if you care to wait for as long as we waited for the Model 3 ;-).

Not that _I_ would, but then I'm a sucker for the driving experience rather than the sound of the doors slamming or the aesthetics of panel gaps (not that those on my 3 are not what they should be, except for the European CCS Combo 2 charge port and the open/close sensor pushing the back side of the port cover away 2mm, something I don't see on US variants, and the head lights protruding 1mm on the underside, with a larger panel gap at the top. If those are the kinds of things that make you lose sleep, then perhaps the model 3 is not the car for you).
""

Correct, it isn't, not anymore. 

All those slapdash assembly issues are things I was either ready to tolerate or tolerate the wait to have them fixed. It was the service organization's ineptitude, on top of the dreadful quality that made me get rid of it. And NONE of the issues I had were unfixable, provided that they gave a crap.

Yes, I tried the eTron at the Audi center in Munich and again here in the US recently. As soon as the EQC is out, I'll compare the two, then I guess I'll pick one and call it a day.

This seems like it would be a very small set of people but maybe I am just out of touch since that is my most used adapter. When I have traveled in CA, Level 2 J1772 destination charging has been an important part of trip planning as it is way more common than Tesla destination chargers. Even when I leave my car at the airport, that is all J1772 charging. 

It just seems stingy to leave that one out, as I think most people will buy it. Like when trucks used to be sold without a bumper. Especially when every other EV on the market comes with one.
""

Not disagreeing with it being popular as it's probably the only one we use too, as my husband's office has ChargePoint chargers there and he will either charge at work, at a Supercharger or at home. I am sure there are people who don't travel much and only use their home set up or a SC. I can't say we have ever used a J1772 however other than his office though.

Hopefully someone will chime in. Only data point I have is my brother with a P3D Stealth (not stock P3D+ except with MXM4s) with a 247Wh/mi flat, calm, 195-mi, average speed about 65mph, but most freeway in excess of 70mph (a big portion at 77mph).
""

Was that with Aero covers on or off? Same for HVAC?

On my aforementioned trip I started the calculation mid-drive. The lowest speed was 62mph, the highest was 86mph, and the average was 74.88mph. I had TACC set to 78mph for most of the drive. 

I'm pretty happy with 255Wh/mi considering. I suppose the only real way to test if the modifications are helping would be to get a P3D+ and a P3D- to all go on the same trip at the same time. Nonetheless, from all the data I can gather I think there is a legitimate 10-12% difference. 

I still have two big holes in my front aero shield and a very un-aerodynamic RPM ""Blade"" Spoiler installed. With the UP Spoiler, I think there's a decent chance of obtaining the roughly 13% @ 75mph they claim. That is slated to arrive end of July.",,0,0,0,0

↑

I own a model 3 but I prefer the traditional boxy shape of an SUV and to that end I drove an Audi e-Tron Quattro today. I was so disappointed and will cancel my order. It seems to me that the overall appearance, fit and paint for this $80,000 vehicle are better than my Model 3. That said the driving experience was extremely poor in comparison, it drove like a truck and from my perspective the user interface isn't nearly as intuitive. I guess I could go on about it but suffice to say it isn't anything like my experience driving my M3. Certainly made me appreciate Tesla even more.
""

I have a Tesla Model S75D (dec 2018) and just picked up an E-tron for my wife a few weeks back. On the road they were both very similar in price in the specs i got @ around $95k. They are really different cars and I don't think the brief comments about how it drives above do it justice. 

Don't get me wrong... I love my Tesla and it's the right car for me but the Audi is right for my wife who is not an early adopter and gadget person. The Audi has really been created to provide an absolute first class ride (rides much better than the S - although I have 21 inch turbines which does not help ride quality on the Tesla) and mimics a gas car when you drive it. For example if coasts and does not re-generate unless you use the steering wheel paddles or start braking - even if you choose ""efficient regen"" in the set-up. Interior quality is also much higher in the Audi vs Tesla. On the other hand, the Tesla driving aids - particularly Autopilot is heads and shoulders above the Audi driving aids which are largely just passive safety aids. Again, I love navigate on autopilot... my wife hates it. I do take exception that the Audi does not have auto parking (it's not an available option). My 2013 Merc 550 GL had it!!

I have seen a lot of write ups about the limited range of the Aud. I wanted to provide some real world context. The Audi is rated at around 206 miles with its 95KW battery (which can only be charged to around 88% - so really 84kw for the 206 miles) vs the Tesla 75Kw for 250 miles. I think it is more important to look at what watts per mile you achieve. To make the mileage as quoted by Tesla you need to to achieve 300w/mile (75Kw / 250 miles). That figure is 407 w/mile for the Audi after taking into account their restrictions on charging. After 679 miles in the Audi it has averaged 496 w/mile in nearly 100% city driving. The Tesla has averaged 417 w/miles over around 2,400 miles with mostly city driving - it has probably done 200 - 300 miles of highway driving on a few short trips. Given the 84kw vs 75kw battery sizes (1.12x ratio) and usage being 1.19x between the Audi and Tesla - real world range is very similar. In fact I only usually charge my Tesla battery to around 80% - 60kw. At the usage I have averaged that's a real world range of 144miles. Even at 88% (to compare to the Audi more evenly) that would be a real world range of 158 miles vs the Audi 84Kw @ 496 w/mile giving a real world range of 169 miles. As you can see, depending on how much fully charge your Tesla battery (given Elon gives your the flexibility to go to 100%) real world range is very similar. I also think the Audi will average out to around 450 w/mile after a couple more months. 

I have not taken either on any really long drives but it is clear that the Tesla charging network where I am (East Coast in CT) is much more established. Wolkswagen is spending a lot to catch up with its Electrify America network but right now I see a few 50kw chargers near me - definitely no 150kw yet.",,0,0,0,0

Its interesting you mention the adjustment on your trade in value. On Teslas website i was quoted 12,700 for my BMW. once I ordered the car the value was 12,000. Luckily I went to carmax, they offered me 13, and Tesla honored it.
""

Wholesale used car prices fluctuate alot over the weeks depending on how many of a car model and condition of it are available at the time (mileage and overall condition).

Hard to say, I am certain lowering it 1.5"" made a difference. I am not sure the UP Front Lip Spoiler made a difference. I would have to do a before and after to say for sure, but their data suggests it should be making a difference.

My baseline was as follows:

9:24AM-11:33AM
Avg Speed: 72.56
Wh/Mi: 335
Ambient: 52f

Considering ambient temps were low, I am assuming the same drive in similar ambient temps to yesterday would bring consumption down to about 300 Wh/Mi.

Does anyone else on here have a Stock P3D+ running stock MXM4's who can do a drive at 75MPH for comparison? It wouldn't be a 1-1 comparison as my aftermarket wheels are definitely not as efficient as the aero wheels, and everyone's aftermarket 18's will vary, but it should be close.

I have a Tesla Model S75D (dec 2018) and just picked up an E-tron for my wife a few weeks back. On the road they were both very similar in price in the specs i got @ around $95k. They are really different cars and I don't think the brief comments about how it drives above do it justice. 

Don't get me wrong... I love my Tesla and it's the right car for me but the Audi is right for my wife who is not an early adopter and gadget person. The Audi has really been created to provide an absolute first class ride (rides much better than the S - although I have 21 inch turbines which does not help ride quality on the Tesla) and mimics a gas car when you drive it. For example if coasts and does not re-generate unless you use the steering wheel paddles or start braking - even if you choose ""efficient regen"" in the set-up. Interior quality is also much higher in the Audi vs Tesla. On the other hand, the Tesla driving aids - particularly Autopilot is heads and shoulders above the Audi driving aids which are largely just passive safety aids. Again, I love navigate on autopilot... my wife hates it. I do take exception that the Audi does not have auto parking (it's not an available option). My 2013 Merc 550 GL had it!!

I have seen a lot of write ups about the limited range of the Aud. I wanted to provide some real world context. The Audi is rated at around 206 miles with its 95KW battery (which can only be charged to around 88% - so really 84kw for the 206 miles) vs the Tesla 75Kw for 250 miles. I think it is more important to look at what watts per mile you achieve. To make the mileage as quoted by Tesla you need to to achieve 300w/mile (75Kw / 250 miles). That figure is 407 w/mile for the Audi after taking into account their restrictions on charging. After 679 miles in the Audi it has averaged 496 w/mile in nearly 100% city driving. The Tesla has averaged 417 w/miles over around 2,400 miles with mostly city driving - it has probably done 200 - 300 miles of highway driving on a few short trips. Given the 84kw vs 75kw battery sizes (1.12x ratio) and usage being 1.19x between the Audi and Tesla - real world range is very similar. In fact I only usually charge my Tesla battery to around 80% - 60kw. At the usage I have averaged that's a real world range of 144miles. Even at 88% (to compare to the Audi more evenly) that would be a real world range of 158 miles vs the Audi 84Kw @ 496 w/mile giving a real world range of 169 miles. As you can see, depending on how much fully charge your Tesla battery (given Elon gives your the flexibility to go to 100%) real world range is very similar. I also think the Audi will average out to around 450 w/mile after a couple more months. 

I have not taken either on any really long drives but it is clear that the Tesla charging network where I am (East Coast in CT) is much more established. Wolkswagen is spending a lot to catch up with its Electrify America network but right now I see a few 50kw chargers near me - definitely no 150kw yet.

Pissing off your existing customer base is NOT a good way to do business but it's clearly the status quo at Tesla these days. Apple needs to just buy Tesla and Elon needs to go. Elon, while so instrumental in getting Tesla going, is now it's biggest weakness and greatest threat.

Yes, the #4 running at a planned 72A load needs the wire to be factored and designed as a 90A circuit. So it’s important to understand what insulation type he’s using. It needs to be THWN-2, THHN,

Please be careful here. Make sure he’s aware this is for an EV and will be subjected to long load times and needs the wire guage type and insulation to be installed per NEC.

Also worth noting that the (pre-Raven) 100D was 335 mi, the P100D was 315 mi - 94.0% of the range of the non-Performance.

RFernatt said:

In a way I agree, but when thinking of manufacturing difficulty and complexity and value, it's the opposite. ICE OEMs outsource most everything except engines and transmissions since those components comprise the core of an ICE, are the most expensive, comprise the most guarded value, where the OEM focuses innovation, research, etc. While electric motors are important, battery systems comprise the bulk of the value and focus of innovation for an EV and are therefore a lot more valuable than a fuel tank or the fuel equivalent of the ICE. In this sense, I would argue the battery system is not a fuel tank, but equal to an ICE engine. The EV motor may be on par with a transmission.
""

My own thought is that the filler neck/fuel tank/fuel pump/engine/transmission system is analogous to the charger/battery/inverters/motors/reduction gears system, but where to divide the line has a lot of questions.

The fuel tank stores chemical energy for the engine to oxidize and convert to mechanical energy, and the transmission matches the speed and torque output of the engine to the vehicle's speed and torque demands.

The battery stores chemical energy and oxidizes the anode to create electrical energy, the inverter matches the electrical energy to the motor's speed and current demands, and the motor converts electrical energy to mechanical energy (which the reduction gear further matches to the vehicle's speed and torque demands, although typically only in one ratio).

So, it doesn't cleanly split, although treating the battery+inverter+motor as roughly analogous to the fuel tank+fuel pump+engine makes sense to me.",,0,0,0,0

Wow.

What makes your driving habits any more valid or correct than mine? are you, like, the Emperor of the Tesla Super Charger highway that your driving habits can just trample on the rest of us peasants without the slightest consideration?

i'm only being faintly facetious here.

do you hear the entitlement in your statement? there are thousands of Teslas on the road. and a limited number of chargers with limited capacity. you can have unlimited free for like supercharging to abuse all you want. this is your right -- actually I personally don't believe that, but i'll play along b/c it sounds like you think you own the whole world and we are your humble servants. Thing is -- come back at 3 in the morning when your favorite SCer site is not 6 cars deep waiting for a charge and pull as many free electrons from the SCer as your callous little heart can stand.

in the meantime, I hope the rest of us will be happy to act in a more neighborly manner and realize that other drivers have similar needs to the SCer network and sitting around for 30 minutes going from 95 to 100% SOC is neither good use of your own time, nor good use of Teala's SCer network.

I too wish that we could wave our magic wands and increase SCer charge rates and capacity but the technology is just not there yet. in 50 years perhaps we will have be able to replenish 500 miles in 5 minutes so all of the cry babies who miss their ICE road trip habits can, you know, shave a few extra minutes off their 8 hour road trip while risking falling asleep at the wheel and putting themselves and god-knows-who else in danger.

I have heard amazing things about the Toyota Camry. very reliable. and you can replenish it's full full storage capacity in roughly 5 minutes from empty today!! Want something a little more Luxe? Toyota's Lexus line makes lovely vehicles. the Germans IIRC also have this technology and some American brands as well, if you would rather go the patriotic route.. and, best of all, you never have to be told to move your stinking Tesla so one of us peasants might get a charge. (the horror!!!)

Happy road tripping, your majesty...

Yes, that's why I really like these. I have leaps and TSLA too, but unlike options, there's no time pressure and they pay back worst case. Plus they have preference and drop less during down cycles. E.g. since I bought mine, TLSA dropped 25% while the bonds dropped 13%. In theory, I could sell a portion of the bonds, and buy equities at a lower entry point. But if the stock went up, I'd participate in the upside through the conversion. 

Another way to look the convertible bonds at $90 is they pay 2.2%, with an effectively strike of $280, because it costs $90 to get $100 face value applied to the conversion.",,0,0,0,0

So, what does that mean - they have a logistics problem where they can make lots of cars, and there is demand for them, but they are unable to deliver them? 



...Musk also said in January that he doesn’t believe Tesla has a demand problem. “The demand for Model 3 is insanely high. The inhibitor is affordability,” he said. “It’s just, like, people literally don’t have the money to buy the car. It’s got nothing to do with desire.

ALAMEDA, CA — An auto burglar zipping around the Bay Area in a silver Jaguar was arrested by Alameda Police after an alert Good Samaritan snapped a photo and provided it to officers, the department reports. APD has labeled the suspect a ""career criminal"" who is responsible for recent crimes in at least nine cities around the area.

Police reported last week that back in February an Alameda resident saw a backpack being thrown out the window of the Jaguar and took a photo. That was the clue investigators needed to solve a one person crime wave.

The backpack had been stolen just minutes earlier at a shopping center parking lot. Officers found that three other vehicles had been burglarized at the same time.

Property Crime detectives turned to License Plate Readers to identify the suspect and meticulously linked him to other Alameda thefts and crimes in other jurisdictions. The suspect has prior arrests for auto burglary, felony evading of police, and concealed weapons convictions and is currently on probation for burglary.

Now arrested and charged, police say, ""This career criminal would not have been identified without the help of the alert witness. So remember, if you see something, say something. Do not put yourself in danger, but try to be the best witness possible.""

Hardly any, no. These are marked clearly with a solid line divider a kilometer or so before the left exit (and usually a solid/dotted line a km before that, which prevent the left lane from switching lanes). You're not passing on the right once you are considered to drive on a ""different road"" because of the markings.

The only exception is an even rarer left entrance. These are usually announced because they are seen as dangerous, and often also marked with solid lines for quite some distance.

Yeah, the car is just not set up for the sort of visibility needed to enter from the left. That's one of the times the great acceleration of the Tesla comes in handy.

So I have been considering this report by Jake related to CR considering AP to be like an inexperienced driver - perhaps young. I reviewed all the FSD HW presentation done by Pete Bannon.

It is important to listen to the comments/criticism from CR. I think I agree to some extent as to the observation but not the conclusion.

Yes, there are times that AP (2.5 for me) has that quality of control that seems unsure and can be uncomfortable. It is silent, I can't tell where it's attention is and I cannot directly interact without moving the wheel or taking control. This is uncomfortable and not the way it would be with an inexperienced human driver. 

I think Jake feels uncomfortable with the veiled nature of the driving decisions and feels uncomfortable. AP does not feel discomfort or the need to explain itself. We humans make assumptions and convert that into conclusions often on not much more than feelings. Tesla is publishing data. The data seems to take a back seat to the feelings but the data, in my book, is the important part.

The reality is that real inexperienced drivers are on the road daily making mistakes and learning as they go in both fair and poor weather. There are people of various capacities driving daily. AP is not that much different other than it is a bit occult as to the internal bits. 

So what I am seeing is that AP is getting better at both driving and also at communicating with humans. The interface is improving with a bit more feedback as can be seen in the red color now used on the lane lines, vibrations, tones etc to clue the driver as to what is perceived. Yes, AP knows there is a vehicle in the blind spot. Good stuff and part of development. AP is having to drive the vehicle as well as manage the occupant experience. 

There is a good question as to whether it is desirable for AP to drive in a manner that makes humans comfortable or whether AP should be turned to highly prioritize safety. These two goals may be mutually exclusive if resources are constrained. I suspect in a few months the new FSD HW and tuned up SW will come closer to satisfying both goals.

And there is the possibility that AP simply drives differently with 8 continuous vision points than a human does with 2.",,0,0,0,0

Another successful undercover operation to combat auto burglaries and vehicle thefts in a West End Shopping Center. APD detectives combined with Alameda County Transit Crimes Unit deputies observed two suspicious vehicles in the parking lots. One vehicle was determined to be stolen (driver arrested); and the other vehicle, had false plates and when contacted, the driver was cited for additional drug and weapons violations.

APD detectives will continue with these proactive enforcement operations, but we again remind people to:

I agree, but...

...I did spend between my pool solar heating and house PV system installs some $36.5k. Also, my inverter died just a tad over a year after they assured me SolarEdge was a great product—needless to say that the 5 weeks it was down I was paying full rates from PGE left me less than impressed. That cost me nearly $350 in full electrical rates for that warranty repair outage. What was great at least I got another unit with no installation or services charges to diagnose and swap the unit out.

Also, I had to point out a code violation they left behind from the original that the inspector didn’t catch either. The last thing a civil engineer should be commenting on is an electrical contractor’s work...and these guy are a large and reputable business in the greater Sacramento area.

Episodes in which you stop breathing during sleep — which would be reported by another person
Gasping for air during sleep
Awakening with a dry mouth
Morning headache
Difficulty staying asleep (insomnia)
Excessive daytime sleepiness (hypersomnia)
Difficulty paying attention while awake

I don't think Tesla has obtained a permit for a car driving around without a licensed driver in the seat such as the current simple summon



Soon, the 150 foot summon will even attract police attention much easier.



It is true that people can sue whether it's a perfect product or a beta product.

So, beta or not beta is not criteria for lawsuit.

However, when a consumer enters into a contract with Tesla, the contract clearly spells out that it's the owners who are responsible for the driving of the car at all times.

If owners don't like that contract, they should either re-write it or don't pay the money which means not entering into the contract.

If I paid my money and clicked on the red paint choice on the web when I receive a red Tesla, I can certainly sue it for delivering me a red car but it does sound ridiculous!

Same logic with buying a beta Autopilot then sue Tesla because it doesn't work like a finished product!
""

I think you don't really understand product liability law. Ok, let's paint this scenario. Someone is injured by a Tesla on autopilot which causes an accident the driver didn't or couldn't prevent. The Tesla driver is sued and the insurance company settles for the maximum amount, but that is not enough to cover all the damages. The injured person goes after the Tesla driver and gets an award, but still there is not enough to cover all the damages. Sooo... the injured then goes after Tesla for the remainder. 

Now, virtually every part of your argument of personal responsibility goes out the window since the driver is no longer part of the equation.

There’s no way a Tesla OR Tesla driver has more accidents than typical. No. Way. Get a new agent/insurance company.
""

No way? That's the sum total of your argument? No facts, no statistics, just ""no way""? 

I've already pointed out one way the model X is unsafe, the poor visibility due to the oversized roof pillars. Another is the overly complex and difficult to operate while driving console. Just adjusting the heater controls requires multiple button presses with no tactile feedback which requires a driver to take his eyes off the road for some seconds while fumbling with the controls. Even looking at the map or the entertainment center causes a loss of focus on the road way. Don't tell me this is never a factor in accidents. Distracted driving is a huge issue in accidents. In Maryland even having a cell phone in your hand while driving is illegal, but pressing buttons on the Tesla console is totally OK even though it can be just as distracting. 

Here's a bit of irony. When on autopilot the driver must maintain a certain level of pressure on turning the steering wheel to let the car know ""hands are on the wheel"". That's when your role is to back up the autopilot. But when the autopilot is disengaged and you are fully responsible for driving the car, there is no monitoring of your hands or your attention... at all.",,0,0,0,0

What is the REAR A/C setting for temperature? It is possible to be different from the front settings....

Someone earlier mentioned 2 compressors in the 6 and 7 seat models.
I believe they all have a single compressor but there is an additional cooling coil and blower in the right rear
of the 6 and 7 seat models that the 5 seat version does not have...
The 6 and 7 seat models definitely have more cooling capacity.

Exactly what information do you need? In your Tesla account, under the History link should be a list of Supercharger sessions, as long as you are getting charged for the electrons. It will list the location, the date and time and the cost. Follow the > link and you can see the amount of kWh used and the price per kWh. A View Receipt link leads to a formal statement in the form of a .PDF. As far as I can tell, about the only thing missing is the estimated range that was added to your car.

Tesla is driven to produce their cars as cheaply as possible right now. One big way of doing that is to share as many parts as possible across all cars. Because of that, I'm almost certain that the S and X will get the same refresh at the same time. If they can, they will make more parts overlap than they have now. I expect whatever parts overlap they can have with the Model 3 will happen too.

The Model S refresh in 2016 was mostly new tech from the X ported to the S with a few trim pieces changed along the way.
""

Agreed. I think this could be a big deal for increasing margins as they consolidate parts. I expect to see a lot from the 3 as well, perhaps with more premium materials facing the cabin, but the underlying parts (e.g. the HVAC louver system) could be shared. I found it odd the S never got the same soft-close doors or door pockets of the X after all this time. I wouldn't be surprised to see this next refresh unify things like that.",,0,0,0,0

The competition has dealers located everywhere in all 50 states that people are comfortable purchasing cars from and are conveniently located for purchase and service, and have salesmen ready to tell whatever lie is needed to make a sale. Dealers add to the cost structure but otherwise they are a big advantage. And even with the Y and the expensive pick-up, there will be substantial holes in Tesla's product line. And what about the warranty and where will people get service after Tesla fails; and repairs take forever because parts aren't available; and what's wrong with you that you that you have children and you would consider buying a car that explodes into flames? All BS but many people believe it. And there is the embarrassment of driving a car that is a failure per the media barrage that people get. Ford couldn't turn the Edsel around for this reason, even though they fixed the styling for Year Two [1959].

Tesla makes the best EV's, and it will take years and lots of money for other manufacturers to develop the capacity to make EV's that are as good at a comparable manufacturing cost, and Tesla will keep improving its vehicles and further cutting costs, but there are also other parts of the marketplace picture.

The dealers are going to take a lot of education and encouragement to sell BEV's. Not saying it won't eventually happen, but it's going to take several years.

Those buyers that were looking for a car as a status symbol will look elsewhere now.

While I always hear the argument on how Tesla's goal was not to make money, but rather save the planet, I wonder if that still holds true.
Tesla is a publicly owned company, who's primary obligation is to its shareholders.
What do you think the shareholders goals are? Money.

So yeah, I do think is possible the Model 3 being priced so low and with such slim margins could have negative side effects.

I agree with your complex scenario.

Similarly, a pedestrian hit by a car can first get compensation from the driver. When the driver's insurance is not enough, the plaintiff can also sue the city because of the road condition, paint markings, traffic lights that allow drivers to turn right when red...

The victim can also sue the manufacturer of the traffic cameras that distracted the driver and the pedestrian got hit as the result. Also the painter who painted the sign that traffic cameras are used in this intersection too! The driver read the sign and got distracted! How else the pedestrian got hit?

So, it's not just a driver, car manufacturer, city but anyone else can be sued too.

Re: Consumer Reports - Comments on Autopilot

So I have been considering this report by Jake related to CR considering AP to be like an inexperienced driver - perhaps young. I reviewed all the FSD HW presentation done by Pete Bannon.

It is important to listen to the comments/criticism from CR. I think I agree to some extent as to the observation but not the conclusion.

Yes, there are times that AP (2.5 for me) has that quality of control that seems unsure and can be uncomfortable. It is silent, I can't tell where it's attention is and I cannot directly interact without moving the wheel or taking control. This is uncomfortable and not the way it would be with an inexperienced human driver. 

I think Jake feels uncomfortable with the veiled nature of the driving decisions and feels uncomfortable. AP does not feel discomfort or the need to explain itself. We humans make assumptions and convert that into conclusions often on not much more than feelings. Tesla is publishing data. The data seems to take a back seat to the feelings but the data, in my book, is the important part.

The reality is that real inexperienced drivers are on the road daily making mistakes and learning as they go in both fair and poor weather. There are people of various capacities driving daily. AP is not that much different other than it is a bit occult as to the internal bits.

So what I am seeing is that AP is getting better at both driving and also at communicating with humans. The interface is improving with a bit more feedback as can be seen in the red color now used on the lane lines, vibrations, tones etc to clue the driver as to what is perceived. Yes, AP knows there is a vehicle in the blind spot. Good stuff and part of development. AP is having to drive the vehicle as well as manage the occupant experience.

There is a good question as to whether it is desirable for AP to drive in a manner that makes humans comfortable or whether AP should be turned to highly prioritize safety. These two goals may be mutually exclusive if resources are constrained. I suspect in a few months the new FSD HW and tuned up SW will come closer to satisfying both goals.

And there is the possibility that AP simply drives differently with 8 continuous vision points than a human does with 2.
""

I'm in the minority, but I'm positive that safety and passenger experience are opposing goals.

For example, if the car drives more slowly at the speed limit, it's likely to be safer. Ditto if it waits longer for an opening.

Otoh, passengers don't want cars driving at the speed limit or that wait too long at a turn. Ironically, I think people will also require fsd to be orders safer than humans before they'll ride with it. 

For these reasons I believe the uses for fsd are different than what most think and will take longer than expected.",,0,0,0,0

There is nothing wrong with wanting your vehicle to be in good condition on delivery day. Paint issues are usually a hassle to deal with since Tesla does not fix them in house. I would not accept delivery on a car that has significant paint issues requiring body work. That’s just silly. It’s a brand new car. You don’t need to be messing around with taking a brand new car to a body shop to get it repaired before you even paid for it. They make over 5,000 of these a week. If you don’t like the one they assigned to you then just request another one. No big deal.

Where I see things go wrong is when people allow Tesla (or their own schedules) to rush them through the delivery process. You should plan on spending an hour going through the vehicle in detail. Bring a second person to go through it with you in case you miss anything. You are doing a pre-purchase inspection on an expensive piece of property. Take the time you need to make sure you have thoroughly inspected it and don’t be afraid to reject it if there are issues you are not comfortable with. We have two Model 3’s that we are very happy with and we’ve had zero issues with both of them. And we’ve also rejected two Model 3’s that were not in acceptable condition at the delivery center. In both cases where we rejected the vehicles the entire staff was very friendly and supportive and totally understanding of the situation.

I had the same problem on my HW 2 S. It happened a few days after the 2019.16.2 update, which I suspect could have been related to sentry mode. After the update sentry mode was enabled by my wife for all locations, including our home, so it was literally running sentry mode the whole time it was parked overnight in our garage every day. I suspect that can cause heat build up and possibly a crash of the AP computer. From reading @verygreen 's reddit posts there's no way to force a restart of the AP computer, however it should restart after your car goes into sleep mode.

In my case AP came back by it's self after the car had been parked for a few hours. The key was I disabled sentry mode first, then let it sit.

What is the definition of NEM? I get paid for exporting energy, but it's only at a fraction of what I pay. Also, I have TOU rates for usage, but fixed rate for export. So, is this NEM?
""

I would not call that NEM. I would call that a Feed-In Tariff system.

With the NEM that is implemented in California, they total the net kWh for each TOU period and multiply it by the rate ($/kWh). They total the dollars for that billing period and add it to your annual true-up balance.

For example: (totally made up numbers)
Peak: -75kWh @ $0.32/kWh = -$24.00
Part-Peak: -200kWh @ $0.25/kWh = -$50.00
Off-Peak: 800kWh @ $0.12/kWh = $96.00

Correct, it isn't, not anymore.

All those slapdash assembly issues are things I was either ready to tolerate or tolerate the wait to have them fixed.

Tesla is capable of building Model 3 vehicles without these problems, I rented one and it was pleasant and very quiet... nothing like the one I purchased.

I spoke too soon about the virtues of 1.37.0. Friday was good, but Sunday has been terrible. There's nothing worse than discharge into Off-Peak. I will post the chart near the end of the day. The problem is that even after powering the house through the Peak on Saturday, the SOC was still relatively high. I think the Powerwall software doesn't logically handle what it feels is surplus energy.

Once again, I spoke too soon. I just checked the Backup History and evidently there was a 1 hour and 5 minute outage today. I have no idea when it was. There were no notifications. The chart shows the Powerwalls discharging for 15 minutes starting at midnight when the Model 3 started charging, then again for nearly 4 hours from ~4am-7am, but there is a taper on both ends, not a hard cutover. If there was only one interval with an intermediate value, you could say that the outage started in the middle of that interval, but the Powerwalls started discharging with 0.2kW at 03:45 and the grid did not read 0.0 until 04:00. The house was drawing 0.7kW continuously during that time.

The house was drawing 0.7kW continuously during that time.
""

So, here's today's chart, with just the home and Powerwalls shown for clarity in the second chart.





Aside from a cloudy crummy solar day, pretty much the only problem I see is the discharge events I mentioned above at midnight and 4-7am. There were other tiny discharges around 8:30am and 1pm, but those are of little consequence.

One more mistake. The outage was on March 26th, not May 26th. So, scratch that explanation.",,0,0,0,0

Nissan dealer is throwing the dice on the funds being available, guess they want to book that sale.

That's what I'm thinking as well. As long as the program is still in effect 90 days before delivery and you've got a VIN, the dealer will just submit the reservation on his end at that time and no one is the wiser. Probably not a bad gamble, because if I was a betting man (as opposed to the stressed-out guy waiting), I'd say all political parties in BC will want to keep this going, at least through October 2021 (next BC election). To do that, though, my niggling fear is that they reduce the $5,000 amount in BC now that there's a federal credit as well. They may be able to justify that reduction (say to $2,500). That's why I'm hoping to get my VIN and funds reserved before the existing $5M runs out. You just never know.",,0,0,0,0

Actually, the Peak period behavior is unchanged. I would not call what it's doing during Peak ""Self-Powered"". I would call it ""Discharge to export All Solar"". The thing I was pointing out in my ""good"" chart on 1.37.0 was the behavior at the start of the Part-Peak period where it is discharging to zero out the grid before the solar ramped up above the household load. In the past, at best, it would put the Powerwalls in Standby at the start of Part-Peak until there was Surplus Solar, thereby reducing the grid contribution until it went to zero when the solar exceeded the household load.",,0,0,0,0

I think you don't really understand product liability law. 
Is Tesla required to sell products that do not cause undo harm? Or are they exempt from product liability law?
""

Wow! Just wow!

I think you are like the worry wort that never stops worrying. If Elon Musk worried as much as you, he never would have started SpaceX (a rocket might fall on someone and kill them), he never would have started Tesla (someone might crash or sue them), he never would have started The Boring Company (there might be an earthquake and the tunnel could collapse). Yes, there is always some risk. That's how progress happens. I'll say it again:

There has never been a product created that didn't create product liability. It's a cost of doing business. When you do it wrong, you go out of business, bankrupt or no one will insure you. But Tesla products are pushing the safety standards forward, not backward. Tesla has expert lawyers in product liability and they know exactly what the risks are and how to increase the safety of their customers and the people at large. Humans are terrible drivers, very inconsistent and refinery pollutants and fossil cars kill thousands every month. You need to stop trying to be Tesla's nanny. The world has enough nannies and if the nannies were in charge, nothing would ever get accomplished. I'm surprised you are brave enough to get out of bed in the morning.

I agree with your complex scenario.

Similarly, a pedestrian hit by a car can first get compensation from the driver. When the driver's insurance is not enough, the plaintiff can also sue the city because of the road condition, paint markings, traffic lights that allow drivers to turn right when red...

The victim can also sue the manufacturer of the traffic cameras that distracted the driver and the pedestrian got hit as the result. Also the painter who painted the sign that traffic cameras are used in this intersection too! The driver read the sign and got distracted! How else the pedestrian got hit?

So, it's not just a driver, car manufacturer, city but anyone else can be sued too.

But the first answer for a Tesla owner about who's responsible is: The manual owner says Tesla does not accept responsibility when a driver is using Autopilot. So don't count on shifting the responsibility to the city, traffic camera company, traffic sign company...
""

You are hitting exactly on the point, but you still aren't grasping the reality. If a company could relieve themselves of product liability by writing a few words, then there would never be product liability. Why woudn't every company making any product with potential of safety problems simply write a disclaimer rather than improve their product? 

Companies being held responsible for the products they sell is a matter of fact in the law. There is no ""shifting"" of responsibility. The issue is simply that the law requires products to be designed with safety in mind. Every company has the responsibility to make their products safe.",,0,0,0,0

Yeah, this happens often sadly. If you open the trunk or especially a door first it will “wake up” the charge port and you will be able to open it with the button. <shrug> a minor annoyance once you figure out the workarounds.

3694551,Long-Term Fundamentals of Tesla Motors (TSLA),acoste,2019-05-26 22:42:00,"Updates after all this noise.
I posted the average of estimates from all analysts 3 months ago: Long-Term Fundamentals of Tesla Motors (TSLA)

Here is an update.

This is what FastGraphs shows right now for the average of analysts' estimates for EPS and operating cash flow.

There are numerous changes on adjusted EPS compared to February.
No more profit is expected for 12/31/19.

adjEPS for
2020 changed from 9.75 to 6.41
2021 changed from 17.28 to 12.53
2022 changed from 28.33 to 21.13
Due to the big drop in estimated earnings growth the expected share price for 12/31/2020 is $103.2




However as mentioned previously this is a growing company and it reinvests most of its revenue instead of counting it as earnings so the share price / operating cash flow is a better indicator. Based on that the share price on 12/31/2020 will be $770.1 assuming P/OCF = 30 (changed from 25.4).
$770 is hardly any change from the value from February! This is due to the steeper curve (lowered near term, lifted values for 2-3 years out)

OFC for
2019 changed from 20.72 to 16.05
2020 changed from 30.37 to 25.67
2021 changed from 35.31 to 36.80
and there is a new value for 2022 with 42% growth expected.





expected P/E growth at 16.1% is more reasonable than the previous value.
estimated P/OCF growth of 30 is on the high side, it is valid for a company with bright future growth.",,0,0,0,0

Het is niet MIJN claim dat ivm de levensduur DC laden slechter is dan AC via de omvormer naar DC laden, maar van experts, specialisten, kenners en zelfs van Tesla die dat allemaal op Youtube verklaren.
""

Met alle respect, ik kan met niet voorstellen dat mensen die het kunnen weten zullen beweren dat ac laden en omvormen naar dc beter is voor de levensduur van de accu dan dc laden, ook als dat met hetzelfde vermogen gebeurd. Want uiteindelijk is dat, bezien vanuit de accu, twee keer precies hetzelfde. Als je een linkje hebt waar dat wel wordt geclaimed, dan ben ik daar heel benieuwd naar. Ik denk eerlijk gezegd dat je hun beweringen wellicht wat uit hun verband hebt getrokken.

Een enkele uitzondering daargelaten (zie plaatje) wordt bij een DC lader met een hoger vermogen geladen dan bij een AC lader en is DC laden dus meer belastend voor de accu dan AC laden. Maar dat heeft niet te maken met het verschil tussen AC en DC lader maar puur met het vermogen dat de accu ingepompt wordt. Zoals in voorgaande posts ook al wordt aangegeven.

Overigens: meer belastend wil wat mij betreft nog niet persé zeggen ""slechter voor de levensduur"".

They will fit, one of the example photos that VMR has on their website for those wheels is a Model 3.

Staggered is definitely possible, but it will hurt your handling and make the car understeer quite a bit. The only time people really do staggered is if they want to make the car look better at the expense of handling.

I think you ordered May 5th? That's not bad at all, given the chaos.

Do you know when you first saw your VIN or delivery date appear online?

I ordered an SR+, Black/Black with 18-inch aeros on May 16th. Will be interesting to see how much extra backlog there was from the 5th to the 16th (I'm guessing it could be ~1,000 cars), and how quickly they can deliver the ones that were ordered during that period. In other words, I'm betting they can take orders faster than they can deliver cars.

From what I can gather reading these forums and checking the order tracking spreadsheet, no one from YVR who ordered my basic configuration after May 7th has received a VIN. Based on your timeline, I'm hoping for a VIN by this Friday with delivery by the middle of June, but time will tell.

I order the same one (BLK/BLK/18) on the same day (16th), but at night (7pm?). Let's see how that goes for us.

1. As I don't have any options added on, total should be just under 55,000. However, tax is calculated based on 13% ($7,160.40) as opposite to 12% ($6609.60). What tax were you see on your detailed finance info page?
2. Did you receive your PIN yet? I don't. But using the ""view source"" method they mentioned above, I can see my VIN in the source code. Not sure if it's the real thing though. 

Good luck on both of us getting the car quicker.

Anecdotes like this are a lot less useful without including the other key information like how many miles the car had, when it was built (2018 model year?), previously rejected, etc. In other words, those reading this shouldn't expect a May 2019 built P3D with 5 miles for $8500 off.
""

Sorry for the lack of info. Originally it was a 2018 white ext, Black int and FSD 36 miles VIN 170xxx Dec 2018 build. Found out recently it was a car that was not supposed to be sold to the public. Was just recently assigned a newer VIN 231xxx 2019 P3D same configuration but with 900 miles in California. Same discount will be given, but we agreed to have additional mileage and delay of delivery compensated. Not sure of the additional compensation just yet. Definitely happy about getting a newer car with a build date approx 04/19 and additional discount for their mess up. Condition of car will definitely be throughly looked over before delivery. Awaiting delivery later this week. Will keep updates coming as car gets closer to delivery.

Relations with car dealers / garages here in Belgium tend to be less adversorial than in the US (even though one issue is that for Tesla a lot of things are decided by Fremont, who really don't have a clue about the various quirks about the way every country operates slightly differently in Europe).

It's not only the dealers/service centres, though: customers usually make an effort not to be unreasonable either (most US people are also reasonable, but you have a share of Entitled Customers from Hell that I would wish upon no company on Earth, and the backlash makes life more miserable for people with more justified concerns).

Over here if you want bad service you go to the official importer of the car brand; they're usually large enough not to care.

It's not only cultural; even in the Netherlands everyone seems to know which SeCs to avoid and which ones not to avoid ;-). Although to be fair in Europe there are even stark cultural differences within countries that would surprise someone from the US.

As far as quality is concerned, perhaps in Europe we are blessed to receive cars that haven't been made under pressure to ship them out the door for end-of-quarter delivery in quite the same manner: to get the cars on a boat in time for delivery they must be produced in the middle of the quarter in Fremont.

Anybody experiencing where setting real_mode to self-consumption results in backup-reserve being reset to 0% (in app), and 5% in Wizard - summary, no matter what the backup_reserve_percent json value is being set to? I'm on 1.35.2 Gateway firmware.

It's also annoying I have to stop and run the Sitemaster between mode changes, as just setting the mode and committing doesn't mean the PowerWall will actually perform the new mode, even though its status IS registering as the new mode. For instance, I've set it self-consumption mode, and then programmatically change it to backup-mode in the evening. However, its behavior stays in self-consumption mode (continues to power the home) until I've restarted Sitemaster. Then its in Standby where I expected it to change to.

Not stopping Sitemaster is possible if just reusing the Oauth token that hasn't expired yet. Getting a new Oauth token automatically stops Sitemaster. I guess this is why the Wizard logs you out everytime you completed some configuration.

Never mind my backup-reserve problem -- it was a typo in my json key when setting that value.

Disclaimer: I washed the car, took extra care to ensure clean sensors and camera's.

Additional Lane Detection Broken
In way, way way to many cases, the car seems to not detect the lanes left and right of you.I first tested the firmware at night, and blamed that (even though I was on the brightly lit beautifully marked 5 lane A2 south from Amsterdam), but experiences over the weekend in both cloudy and bright weather tell a different story. It happens all the time.

No more lane detection/display on non-freeways
Previously, the car would detect and display additional lanes also on multi-lane highways (80/100 km national roads in NL) - So far, I haven't seen it do that anymore.

Autosteer
Which brings me to autosteer. Because of the previously mentioned change, I can no longer manually ask Autosteer to change lanes/overtake on non-freeways.
Regarding the steering angle limitation: I haven't noticed a limitation yet. It could be that it takes some corners a bit slower than before (and still does like a student driver that focuses too much on the road 5 m in front of the car, instead of looking 30+ meters ahead for a more fluent experience).
An example:


This curve-with-intersection (going west->north) was navigated on autosteer with an 'appropriate' speed (for my mom  ), which means a serious steering input by the car.

NoA available but mostly useless
NoA is available on all freeway routes I've tried since thursday.
* It does suggest takeing over (for speed) - IF it detects a lane to the left (50%)
* It does properly suggest lane changes for navigation - unless it doesn't see the right/left lane...
* It does NOT actually go left if there's a car coming up from behind (no matter how slow or far)
* It often cancels for timeout (because it's chicken *sugar* and doesn't dare to go left)
* It often cancels (even violently midway through) apparently because it no longer sees the lane (my theory)
* It hardly ever dares/manages to actually make the lane change (timeout, cars, lane 'lost')
* It once suggested going to the middle lane in order NOT to exit (even though the right lane is not going to be an exit lane) - could be a map issue
* If I'm on the right lane near my planned exit, it nicely exits the freeway (but once ON the exit lane, the display disturbingly shows that it's going to hard exit that lane to the right as well - but fortunately doesn't).

In short: doesn't help, feels dangerous and unpredictable to me, other drivers. Will NOT use for a second with passengers in the car. (I tried, and my wife kindly convinced me that should would drive the rest of the way).

Tonight, I'll return WITHOUT NoA to see if this update affected autosteer on the freeway in any way.

Other
* Rare cases of phantom breaking (no change)
* Gut feeling: more cases of phantom-slowing-down in refusal to pass a car in the right line.",,0,0,0,0

While I understand the rate of issues is probably higher than the rate of an established company, its still a very small percentage.

What do you mean by ""very small percentage""? Less than 1%, less than 10%, less than 25%? Nobody but Tesla knows the percentages, do you have a source that confirms your claim that it's a ""very small percentage""? We know it's a large enough percentage to justify to Tesla to refuse fixing things like yellow screens (unless the customer pays for it themselves) - if it was just a few cars, Tesla would have replaced the screens without affecting their bottom line. As for fixing cars after accidents, TMC has people post both positive and negative experiences, but it seems negative is higher percentage than positive. Unless you are like Elon or @OBX John and can simply buy a new Tesla every time your current Tesla needs collision repairs, and not worry about any depreciation or sales tax credit you might lose whenever your old one is fixed, you're not likely to experience positive collision repair.",,0,0,0,0

↑

Took delivery last night to find out I have a super lemon. BEWARE 2019 EARLY APRIL BUILDS. They are rushed.

Clips missing from all tires wells. No paint in door jams deformed dash, and windows that somehow passed inspection with the doorframe pieces twisted.
Overall paint job terrible, with dust flects in almost every inch. If you run the hand along with the paint it feels like little bumps all over.
""

I had a few defects/issues upon delivery, none of them too major though.
My list was as follows:

- passenger side front door interior trim mounted wrong. A clip was mounted towards the outside instead of the inside. This resulted in a visible gap and bulge. Has been fixed (partly) by now. As the clip had been pressing against the wrong side of the interior door seal, this is now irreparably damaged and has to be changed. Part is on order, service center said they will send a ranger round to me once it has been delivered. Looking at one of the pictures @MIDRANGEORDER posted (https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/attachments/img_20190422_114810781-jpg.399949/), I think he had the same issue.

- several patches of dirt on the dashboard that didn't clean off with the usual means. Service center fixed this with some special kind of cleaning agent that needed to set for a coupe of days afterwards. Anyway, looks fine now.

- missing valve cap on front passenger side wheel. Replaced.

- clips on the underside floor cover loose (almost all of them). Fixed some myself, the ones I missed were fixed at the visit to the service center.

- several patches of dirt on the headliner around the windshield and sunvisors. Cleaned this myself using the ""magic shaving cream solution"".

- missing USB cable. Replaced

The only issue I had that I didn't get done because the car went straight to the PPF installer were all the paint defects. As @MIDRANGEORDER said, the paint job leaves a lot to be desired. Spots all over the place like they didn't clean off dust particles before painting the car. My PPF installer just shook his head at this kind of quality. Then again, he has done several more Model 3 by now and those had even worse paint jobs than mine. Anyway, most of the defects were in areas like the door frames where you don't see them once the doors are closed, but overall, paint quality is my biggest gripe about the car. Just not what you expect from a car in that price range. Especially when compared to our e-Golf which was about half the price but with flawless (and far more durable) paint.",,0,0,0,0

Well, since mine is pre-facelift I wanted to see what my filter looks like even though it isnt a HEPA capable model. I pulled it out and it looked to be in good shape but fit very loosely and I noticed dirt around the edges of the filter and small particles like large dust or small sand behind where the filter would be.

Dirt behind filter:
 

You can also see dirty outside edges of the filter on a previous post by ReversePolarity here: Link

I had some 3/16 vinyl weather stripping leftover from another project and added some to 2 sides of the filter. It was a sung fit and I feel like it makes a much better seal and doesn't move around as much in the enclosure. Ideally i would have gone with something wider (1.5"") and a bit thinner (1/16"") so I could do all 4 side but I dont think that size is easily found and I already had this sitting around:
 

I then cleaned the air box where i found the dirt so I can check on it later to see if there were any improvements:
 

I just did it last night so I have don't have enough ""data"" to see if it helped with actually filtering the air instead of letting it go right around the edges and corners. It's weird that Tesla made a decision to go all out with their HEPA filter on the new cars after leaving such a poor solution in place in the older cars for so long and not having an updated filter with small foam edge to make a tighter seal like some other brands as seen below for a non-tesla car:",,0,0,0,0
3694911,Boston Area - Full Set 19” Original Wheels with Winter Tires,Towerchaser,2019-05-27 05:15:00,"Hi all,

Here’s the deal. I’m looking to sell / unload a full set (4) of original style 19” wheels, with tires, original to my Model S. 

The wheels themselves have about 20,000 miles on them. The tires are Michelin X-Ice winter tires with under 5,000 miles on them (driven for one season). 

I recently moved away from Boston and, stupidly, failed to tell the movers about my storage unit in which the tires reside. I’m Back in Boston this Monday thru Thursday morning and looking to unload these in that window. I can post / send pictures as soon as Monday when I’m back in Boston. 

Of course, my interest in getting these off my hands puts you the buyer at an advantage. I’m happy to hook up a fellow Tesla owner but also am hoping to walk away with enough to feel better about the whole thing overall (especially after completely failing at getting them shipped for free with the movers on the government’s dime). Absolute worst case, I’ll stash them with a friend and drive or ship them back myself.

3694978,How was your model 3 quality when you took delivery?,TyH2009,2019-05-27 06:05:00,"All in all I had a fantastic order and delivery experience with my 3.

My delivery appointment was scheduled for 2:00, we arrive and the delivery associate came and said that the car arrived on the truck later than expected, so it still needs to be washed and prepped, no biggie, the St. Louis Service Center is in an area with lots of shopping, so went and killed some time at Bass Pro for about an hour.

Once we came back, the car was parked up front on a charger, they apologized for the delay, and told me to go ahead and check the car out. I had all the time I wanted to check over the car, was not rushed at all. The paint was in great shape, I found a few minor dust spots, no biggie, and a few spots that I thought were imperfections, but were just dried water spots. I brought some Quick Detail spray and they came off. Only thing I found was the passenger side window had a chip/gash about 2-3 inches tall in it, and when I brought it up to my Delivery guy, he had already saw it and had it noted and had a work order placed to have it fixed. An appointment was made for that next week, pending the glass came in.

Long story short, the delivery process was great. I did not feel rushed, I was shown all the tech stuff, even though I watched enough YouTube videos I probably could have taught other people.

On the way home, I noticed the AP circle wasn’t moving, my drive was mostly highway, about 25 miles, they had said it could take up to 100. Drove a few more days, still hadn’t moved, so I called the Service Center and they pushed the software to me, I updated it, and went to go drive, and it was 75% learned before I even got to the highway. Very cool all it took was re-loading the software.

Also I noticed that there was a small imperfection in the windshield, when you would be driving on a 2 lane road, when you look to the right to see the line, it would kind of blur. I brought it up to them when I brought the car in to have the side glass repaired. The tech was able to see it, and agreed it wasn’t normal and a windshield was ordered.

That day that I brought it in for the side window to be replaced, I was given a rental Model S, went and got some lunch, ran some errands, and came back about an hour and a half later, they said that it would only take about an hour and a half or 2. Came back and was told that when they took the replacement glass out of the box, it was scratched up and not acceptable. They apologized left and right, no biggie, things happen it wasn’t their fault. They were going to get a new piece ordered, as well as the windshield and would call me when both were in, and would make sure before I came in for the appointment that they were not scratched up. I was told the windshields were currently on backorder, so could be a few weeks. No biggie, the car is safe to drive.

Got a call 2 weeks from then saying both were in and I can come in to get them replaced. I asked if I could drop it off after work, get a rental again and then bring it back the next day, they said that’s totally fine, and that they couldn’t get to it late in the day anyway, and one of the glass specialists wouldn’t be there until the morning so it works out great.

Dropped the car off, got another Model S as a rental, and was on my way home. Came back the next day after work and the car was done, dropped it off, I went over the car to make sure more issues didn’t come after the work, everything looked great, and I was on my way.

In summary, I haven’t had any major issues with my 3, but it hasn’t been perfect. I must say that my Service Center has been fantastic though through everything.

Environment: Approx 7K 100% MP3 VBR files with highly curated metadata, for the most part playing happily by Genre or Songs on random nearly all the time.

Symptoms & Resolution: Yesterday while driving, as the next tune should have started playing, there was SILENCE. I looked over at MP on the CID, and Album Art for the next track was greyed-out with a dark circular arrow and the words ""Loading Error"". I simply touched the Loading Error icon and the (previously greyed-out) track started playing as it should have on it's own.

NOTE: In the past before I moved to 100% MP3 VBR files, touching this error icon would not always resolve the situation. I found at least once that high bitrates I used which MP wasn't expecting, may have caused the issue; Re-encoding the same track changing nothing else except with lower bitrates worked. In this situation however, since I didn't change anything with the track and got it to play, it's clear the failure is rather MP logic failing in some situation beyond an owners control.​
This isn't a super big deal in the scheme of things, but it's clear the occasional Loading Error bug that appeared more prevalent to me in the past -- and not seen by me for some months -- is still possible with 2019.12.11.

I'd say all political parties in BC will want to keep this going, at least through October 2021 (next BC election).

That's why I'm hoping to get my VIN and funds reserved before the existing $5M runs out. You just never know.

I would like them to change it by eliminating incentives for hybrids and dedicating the money to BEV, FCV, and a reduced incentive for PHEVs. The incentive for hybrids was important 10 years ago to help consumers’ acceptance of the technology.

Hybrids are mainstream now though. I think of the application of these funds to hybrids as being incentivizing the buying of GHG-producing ICEVs.

That I actually do agree with. BTW, you can own the very first Roadster ever built (I'd give you an award for that but am fresh out of awards) and still short the stock. Owning the product doesn't mean a relationship of unwavering love exists. How long you've been involved with the company is exactly of zero interest to me. I reported to a guy who bought one used...it's a toy. In the late 70's we called that conspicuous consumption. But that was the point of it.

By the same logic I can also criticize a company without having a financial interest in it (which was my whole point). But any criticism of Tesla here on TMC immediately gets you accused of shorting the stock.

Management as a career is of interest to me and I've both lived and studied a large amount of it over the years. I'm simply calling it like I see it, banging away on a keyboard to post my opinions on an Internet forum, which is what all of us are doing. 

I'm not sure what the point of your ""toy"" comment was but the Roadster was my Daily Driver for over 6 years when I lived in the Bay Area. And short of getting a flat tire one day it dutifully got me to work and home each day. Back in 2010 I changed roles at my company and instead of commuting to SFO I was commuting on 101 every day. I bought the Roadster for HOV lane access. I was planning to buy a Leaf but at the time the waiting list was like a year as it hadn't come out yet. We were able to afford the Roadster and my wife and I decided that being home an extra hour per day was worth the money (this was back when HOV access actually helped with travel times) so we bought it.

I'm currently on 2016.16.1.1 and checked the CAN ID 382 frame and it's still reporting 4.0. I'll check again when I get the 2016.16.2 update. Who knows why it was increased but perhaps they were seeing more early shutdowns (prior to 0% SOC being displayed) then desired so they've increased the ""kludge factor"" or ""pad"" on the bottom end? I'm assuming this will also make the rated range display something less than before at SOCs <100% (as it already seems to be the case based on that thread I linked to).

I suspect it is concerned they represent merging traffic or something, not sure, but sometimes on curves where there are concrete retaining walls the TACC will slow unnecessarily.

Other than that it's very solid, and correctly reads 2 vehicles deep ahead too, incase the person you're following is too close to the vehicle in front of it or the lead vehicle is slowing before the one directly in front of you.

""What, do you feel, makes AP deadly?""

Skills atrophy. That combined with a basic inability of the system to see large stationary objects such as trucks, freeway lane barriers, stopped cars, etc. AP is so good under normal circumstances that heavy AP users eventually get to the point where they trust the system too much, and their own abilities to remain vigilant and ready to take over quickly diminish.

I don't understand how people don't get that. You can debate until the cows come home about the drivers responsibility. Yes, it is always the drivers duty to be in control of the vehicle. Turing on Autopilot cedes physical control and then requires mental control to safely drive the vehicle. That metal sharpness fades with repeated use of AP. It's like my teenage daughter that has trouble with simple math calculations because her phone does all of the work most times.
I did not buy EAP, and will not until such time that the system can handle not killing me via decapitation when a freaking 60 foot tractor trailer crosses in front of me.

Bprdwa said:

hi all -

I have a November 2018 build MX75d. 

I have read some threads here that indicate that driving in a suspension above “low” has the potential to, over time, lead to acceleration shudder when accelerating between 40 - 60 mph due to stress on the half shafts. 

When I asked my service center about this, they indicated that “speed” was hard on the half shafts, and that half shaft acceleration shudder they was considered normal and not a warranty item. They declined to specify what “fast” meant - accelerating quickly? Driving over 50? Over 70? Over 90?

Because I don’t want the shudder to appear - this car has enough squeaks and rattles already - I’ve been driving everywhere on low. I’m now worried I’m shortening my tire life, and I’ve also noticed that when I do put it in “normal” the ride is substantially smoother and more comfortable. On low I feel every tiny bump in the road. 

Should I be leaving my car on “always low”? Is having the suspension set to lower above 50 going to lead to half shaft shudder?

Is it speed or acceleration that damages the half shafts? If acceleration, how does anyone stand to drive a P100d?

The max amps is set by the plug adapter you installed in your UMC. A Schuko is rated for a maximum of 16A, but Tesla derates to 80% of the plug rating for safety (as required in many countries). So a Schuko will normally top out around 13A, not the 32A of a USA 14-50. So that 8A is not far off from the max it should select. Try looking up the Tesla specs on the exact plug adapter you are using: that is most likely what is happening. 

Also, what voltage is the plug displaying on your Tesla screen? Tesla further degrades the current if the voltage is low.

Wow! I have never seen a panel like that. Must be a Canadian thing.

Props to @wtfuzz - I suspect he is correct in the Federal Pioneer guess. Those breakers very much look like Federal Pacific ones, but yeah, no red on the handles and the panel looks nothing like others I have seen.

It looks like a lot of sticker data from the front of it might be missing? I would love to see the inside of it (with detailed pictures of any stickers and all the wiring) if that was possible to do safely.

I am not an expert in breaker safety testing, but if you believe a lot of what is written up on the Internet, the Federal Pacific story is pretty damning. It seems generally accepted that the Federal Pacific Stab-Lok stuff is a latent fire hazard. In most cases I hear home inspectors will flag them and recommend replacement prior to sale. It is really a tragedy that US regulatory bodies have not taken up this issue and either published strong documentation on the risks of these panels, OR cleared their names so folks can make wise decisions about replacing them or not.

Federal Pioneer is obviously a separate company in Canada, but with the same base breaker designs. Again, if you read what you find on the Internet, their stuff may not fare any better than the US made stuff.

Should Federal Pioneer FP Stab-Lok® Panels & Circuit Breakers be Replaced?

If it were my house, I think without a doubt I would replace it. Not only is there that question of the safety, but there is also the limit to 125 amps and you have a stated desire to go higher. So yeah, I would encourage you to pursue options.

Good luck and please report back on what you end up doing!

P.S. Asking local resources about their safety (electricians, home inspectors, code inspectors, etc...) might be a good idea. I am positive you are not the only one around with those panels.

Downplaying the danger of Chernobyl | Letters

Tom Allan’s report of his holiday inside the Chernobyl exclusion zone (Nuclear reaction, Travel, 25 May) was both misleading and dangerous in its assertions. He gives the impression that the radiation dangers are minimal: “less radiation risk than on a single transatlantic flight”, according to his ornithologist Belarusian guide, Valery Yurko.

The problem around Chernobyl is not average radiation exposure but the millions of highly radioactive hotspots of radioactive particles spewed from inside the destroyed Chernobyl reactor core. The entire exclusion zone area has suffered from serious forest fires in the 33 years since the catastrophe, re-suspending these hot particles into the atmosphere and spreading them around.

I would recommend Mr Allan re-read the chilling warning in the incisive article by Dr Kate Brown of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology seven weeks ago (Chernobyl’s disastrous cover-up is a warning for the next nuclear age of radioactivity, 4 April), based on her excellent new academic study Manual for Survival: A Chernobyl Guide to the Future.",,0,0,0,0
3695294,"Air suspension always acts like is, or is it new?",scottm,2019-05-27 08:06:00,"I swear I used to be able to set the suspension height to Low and have it stay there for my whole trip. And the auto-lowering, once triggered, would also keep the car on Low for the trip. But more often than not, now when I check just before arriving the car has returned to Standard height by itself, after I've put it in low, or auto-lowering was triggered.

I'm think behavior changed with some software version... what's going on? I'm started to chase down the behavior to understand the way it is working now. (I am currently suffering on software level 2019.8.5 as a data point).

Auto-lowering, also auto-raises, what?!

When the car is set to ""auto-lower at speed"" (I set speed to 100 km/h) it goes to low like it should... and if the car slows down afterward it will auto-raise back up to standard height once some slower speed has been reached. I watched it do this. If you stay above this slower speed the height remains low. But below it, the car triggers standard height. I'm trying to determine the speed... maybe 50 km/h... Anybody know it? What I see thought is sometimes it will rise to standard but sometimes it stays on low even going slower that this trigger point. I'm thinking maybe it's a combination of lower speed being held for some amount of time before it auto-rises to standard. So if it's a quick dip on speed it won't bother doing a raise-lower cycle.

Following this auto-rise event, if you speed up again and hit the auto-lowering point, it will lower again. I think all the time. I will verify this.

Manual is not totally manual, what!?

OK, auto-lowering aside.. when I use the height setting button to lower it manually.... you'd think the car would just stay where it's put, right? But what I'm noticing is when I reach end of trip the car might have again returned to standard height. What the heck?

My theory on this is: If the ""auto-lower speed"" is reached after manually punching in low, the car will revert to rules of how that works (above) and cycle the car up/down based on speed. But if you punch in low, and never reach the auto-lowering speed afterwards, the car stays in low. I'm going to do a few drive cycles like that.

Then I'm going to turn off auto-lower altogether, and see if the car just stays in low ""forever"" after manually putting it to low. Regardless of what peak and lower speeds are reached on the hiway. If that's true, I think the question will become, when does the car ever resume to standard height? My hunch is it will take more than stopping, I think it will take more than putting it in Park, I think it may take an exit / re-entry to kick it back to standard when you put it in gear.

Rural America's population is in free-fall - and all farming operations are running out of labor.

And, the largest?, certainly one of the largest sources of atmospheric CO2 increase, is a loss of organic matter in the soil. (Gabe Brown's youtube speeches/book is a great source on how to reverse this. The USDA is behind his stuff, and he's a rancher, who started doing techniques to improve his soil for increased profitability, so they really do work, in all levels.)

Is there a way to get young, ecological, people more interested in farming, as a proactive, and profitable, way to improve the environment? Restoring fish migration/mollusk habitat, and soil, are probably the two largest, and economically simplest, methods to real improvements. 

Would Tesla making a light-duty tractor help? (Might actually make sense. Most folks with a tractor under 60HP are not running it constantly, and it would be easier to keep up with.) 

There is no money in farming, when you sell, and buy inputs, from the same few suppliers - they will rig prices against you - but ""never till"" farming gets people off buying most of the inputs/improves crop health/nutrient density/better to just read Brown's book. 

Is there a way to get young people to listen to a bunch of Christian, fairly conservative, farmers and ranchers about how to heal land, and turn a profit. (""Stewardship"" has always been a large part of rural culture.)

Like most things, though, success does require mud and blood - not as much money, anymore, though. Plenty of regions of the country where ag land values have collapsed to a point where farming should be fairly attractive.

↑

I exclusively use Optimum's products, because everything I've used so far as just worked well and it's not terribly expensive... hard to disagree with that!

I love doing ONR washes. Opti-seal is best applied on a dry, clean surface, but it is possible to wash, clay + wax, and seal in sequence (theragcompany has a video on it). Add a 2nd coat 12+ hours later, but no sooner. Finish with Optimum Car Wax (easy to apply spray wax) and you are good to go. I have their clay towel and it's also excellent. I would not apply Opti-seal every wash, because it's a sealant and it should last several months unless you use something that strips the sealant off - some car wash soaps (particularly the stuff at any business wash place), Optimum Power Clean, are some examples of things that will deteriorate the sealant. If doing proper maintenance washing with ONR, Opti-seal can last 6+ months according to Yvan Lacroix (OPT's training director). Still, every 3-4 months I'd probably strip the paint with Power Clean and start fresh since the products are easy to apply and cheap to do so.
""

I totally agree with you. Overall I have been very impressed with Optimum products. As we have been discussing here, I love the new Hyper Seal (like Opti Seal on steroids, due to the SiO2 content). The only Optimum product that is not my favorite is Opticlean, which is their waterless wash. It is a very good product, however I don't like the fact that since the solution is white in color it is hard for me to see the fill line when mixing the concentrate solution in my favorite spray bottle, which happens to be white also. In addition, I believe the dilution ratio is 4:1 so you don't get that many washes out of a single bottle. My new go to waterless wash is Mckee's 37 Waterless Wash On The Go. It is an orange color so it is super easy to see the fill line when adding water in the spray bottle. And the dilution ratio is 16:1, so it is more cost effective.

I guess this is where I disagree a bit. Yes, Autopilot requires an attentive driver right now since it is still L2 but I would not agree with your characterization that all 10 features are ""mediocre, potentially dangerous and require a lot of baby sitting and eyes on the wheel always"". I feel that is a bit of an exaggeration. For example, Auto Steer is not mediocre. Auto Steer is quite solid now and works very well on roads with good lane lines. Yes, you should be attentive but it does not require a ton of baby sitting. Same with TACC. It is quite good now. Yes, you should be attentive like for stopped vehicles on the side of the road but I would not say that it requires a ton of baby sitting. It is also worth noting that Autopilot will require a lot more baby sitting if you try to use it in driving conditions that it is not yet designed for, like city streets. In driving conditions like highway driving, where Autopilot is best at, yes, it requires monitoring since it is L2 but I would not say that it requires a ton of baby sitting. And if you use AP correctly, it is not dangerous.

I'm not sure how you're coming to this conclusion or what you're comparing it against, but over the last 5-7 days, Tesla has been adding hundreds of new (and used) cars to available, listed inventory. Model S new inventory is nearly at 1000 cars now, which historically is pretty high compared to the last two years. I think the highest it's been has been around 2000. So I wouldn't call 1000 cars ""very low"" by any measure. Also, Model S and X new inventory has been at zero cars for many months at a time last year.

Do we know for a fact, that all inventory is automatically pushed online and is available/produced? 

Maybe it is silly:
Example: There may be 500 M3Ps, with red color, white interior and performance wheels. Why list all 500 of them? Why not list 100, and add slowly the rest as they find buyers. 

What would be Tesla's motivation to effectively disclose the amount of inventory vehicles, when they are trying their best to obfuscate this number?

Regarding the CT placement. I looked inside the main panel and see both the Neurio and Tesla CTs stacked on top of each other with the wire going through all of the CTs. They are all touching. Does that affect the accuracy (i.e. should they be separated)? 



NuShrike said:
↑

I have the same setup.

1) Technically, the Neurio is accurate as a ""site"" CT because it's exactly what the utility company sees.
When charging it's a load in the system, which counts against solar.
When discharging, it's a generator that's zeroing system load just like solar. Its source of energy is not counted as a ""system"" drain.

2) This must be a difference in the placement of the CTs where one is measuring load the other doesn't see. The one with the CTs placed closest to the utility line source is the more accurate one.

Yes, exactly! We have differing things we each would include at the micro level. I can see the macro features being very useful for marketing. Can we have a data sheet of what actually is in the delivery though? Seems like every release there are improvements but we don't know what they are and folks have to decipher them through reverse engineering.

We know these descriptions of improvements should be available. Otherwise how does management know that their developers are actually doing something? I sure would appreciate granular detail in some document that I could access as an owner describing what they did. Something like ""AP will now identify the primary car in white and secondary cars in grey with noticed cars in shadow relief, secondary cars are defined to be ones that could become primary"" or ""AP now detects the primary car leaving the current travelling lane to avoid phantom braking"". There are so many.

This kind of granularity would also be helpful to Tesla. Instead of saying something like ""we improved the autowipers"", and getting responses like ""no you didn't"". If they told use ""we changed autowipers to detect mist and in that situation wipe once per 5 seconds"" they would get feedback like 5 seconds is too long or too short. Folks who don't want the granularity can skip it all. But me thinks that this group wants it. Just look at the disappointment voiced each time release notes are too macro to be useful.
""

Totally agree!!! I too would love much more detail in the release notes. I sometimes think that the regressions owners see in Autopilot is the result of Tesla making a change for a good reason but the change having unintended consequences.

Until I got my futuristic, cutting edge Tesla Model 3 two months ago, my daily driver was this 1951 MGTD MKII. It was REALLY my daily driver, drove from west coast Florida (VENICE) to San Francisco and also to Prince Edward Island. Some say I am crazy, or gutsy or BOTH. The MG motto is Safety Fast. It’s not so fast, 0 - 60 in 18 seconds, top speed 80.25 mph. My M3 SR+ does it (supposedly) in 5.3 seconds. Like no comparison but love both cars. Just have to remember to always use the brake on the MG. I have gotten so use to regenerative braking.

Yes, all the interiors in every Model 3 variant are the same minus some speakers and features. You can even upgrade to white interior on the SR


See here




IMO SR+ really isn't worth the extra cost now if you are looking for the most affordable Model 3. It has like 3 small features and 20+ miles over the SR + Autopilot (if you really want it). $4,500 price difference if you keep everything black and aero.


You'll notice no difference aesthetically in the interior.


SR is truly the bargain Model 3. And you can upgrade to SR+ in your SR if you want. Still don't know the price to upgrade but shouldn't be unreasonable
""



While it is ""likely"" that tesla offers an upgrade from SR to SR+ at some point, it would also be ""reasonable"" to expect the cost to be at LEAST the difference in price between the two when purchased new. tesla pretty much will have to do that (the ""autopilot discount"" fiasco proves that SR+ buyers would throw a complete @#[email protected] fit if it ended up being cheaper to get the SR+ features upgraded from SR than it was for them to buy it new).

Given that, the expectation should be that, it will cost at least as much as the difference cost new, and likely a bit more than that. That would be the expectation I had if I was looking at it. Since Autopilot is ""standard"" in an SR+, that means to upgrade, they will likely charge the upgrade price for autopilot, + whatever they will charge for the other bits. I would expect an SR upgraded to SR+ to end up costing 500 to 1k more than an SR+ purchased new, when this all shakes out.

I am wondering if thats what you mean by ""unreasonable""?",,0,0,0,0

I think an electronic device is going to be able to increase throttle position from 0-100% faster than any human foot, however like you said, it depends if the motor can respond that quickly.
""

When I looked at throttle plate to pedal position mapping of my gas car, I saw that at 60% of pedal travel the throttle was already 100% open. Basically the last 40% of the pedal is useless but feels good to mash it there. Yes, I could have tuned the map to use more of the pedal travel which would have made the car feel even more sluggish than what it was (pressing harder to get the same result). Or, I could have tuned the curve to more aggressively open the throttle but still be maxed out at 60% travel, or I could have shortened the pedal travel to max out throttle at say 50% of travel, but I figured that would make the pedal feel more and more finicky... hard to dial in what you want and calls for small foot movement controls... and ultimately would hurt the fuel economy because the tendency would be to ""over press"" for what is really needed.

Keep in mind this was all for a gas car, which cannot really respond quickly enough to small differences in pedal input to make an overall difference. The problem is not how fast the driver can press the pedal... it's about what the car can do in responding to that input.

On an electric car, the motor is immediate response. But still, it is the limiting factor not the driver's right foot and pedal mapping. Any kind of map in the footwell region is good enough and an average physically enabled person can ""overwhelm"" what the car is capable of doing in a few milliseconds. That's why I think remapping a pedal is a total waste of money and effort, gas, or electric car.

For a drag race, imagine replacing the pedal with a binary switch. 100% power request at 1 degree of travel. I bet such a car wouldn't do appreciably better at the finish line than the car's standard pedal map.. because both drivers know to time 100% release before the light turns green.

I had a P85D (my car), now on our second 3 (my wife's car, switched to P3D- from RWD due to better handling in snow). Here are my thoughts - in part similar to what others have said.
1. No question in my mind that P85D was the better, more luxurious car. 
2. We got the 3 for my wife for 2 reasons: she simply would not consider a 6 figure car under any circumstances (""cars are just for transport""); we also could not justify the price difference for the S - at that time, P100D started at ~130k if I remember correctly.
3. So what do I get in a year when my lease expires on the Merc E coupe? I thought Taycan would be nice - put a deposit down. The longer I wait, the less enthusiastic I am. Latest news have the ""over 300 mile) range on the NDEC cycle, which translates to perhaps 250 miles EPA. For me that is a no go - it will not allow my winter travel to Minneapolis without charging (~190 miles total). The Audi e-tron, Merc ECQ, and Jaguar iPace are all in the same category (besides I do not like SUVs in the first place).

The more I think about it, the more likely I am to get a new model S. The price now on the model S long range with all options is 99.5k today. I am expecting the interior refresh - people keep saying it will be second part of this year or early next year. 370 miles of range completely kills range problems even in the most adverse weather.

My prediction is model S and X will come back to the ~100,000 car sales per year soon - all at the expense of the high-end German and Japanese competitors.",,0,2,0,0

In the 1st quarter, we registered one accident for every 2.87 million miles driven in which drivers had Autopilot engaged. For those driving without Autopilot, we registered one accident for every 1.76 million miles driven.

Labour pledges to put climate emergency on school curriculum

Labour has pledged to make the global climate emergency a core element of the school curriculum from primary school onwards, in response to demands by young people taking part in a series of school climate strikes.

As young activists around the world prepare for another day of strike action on Friday, Labour’s shadow education secretary Angela Rayner said a Labour government would ensure that the climate crisis was an educational priority and that all young people were taught about its ecological and social impact.

I really wish people would stop telling others that salvaged = dangerous. Salvaged only means the repair cost was too high ( there are a lot of variables and I wont get into it ). Think about what would happen if someone stole your car and removed all the glass, interior, bumpers and lights. Yup, it would be considered totalled/salvaged even though there was no damage done to the car structure itself. Replace all the missing parts and you have a perfectly safe vehicle with a salvaged title. If the welds were shotty then it was not repaired at a reputable shop and that's on the buyer for not doing there homework about the history and repairs done.

If the op car was repaired at a reputable shop then I would look into that shop to see what all was done to it and if in fact they replaced any sensors or other pertinent items that could be deemed at fault. But but but, it's on the purchaser to check the car out if it has a salvaged title so there will be no recourse to the person or shop that did the repairs.
""

The problem is that the quality of salvaged cars is highly variable. 

Some are just as good as other used cars. 

Others may be actively dangerous to drive.

Traditional solar installs, and solar roof production to some extent, are just the infrastructure to let Powerwalls do their thing. I'm sure Tesla would be perfectly happy skipping forward 6 years to when solar is more mainstream, but we've seen again and again that Elon is better off leading the progress. Look at residential solar as a whole, it's completely stagnated since Elon shut down SCTY.

As for ""success"" via the solar roof....to me that like saying GoPro will be successful. It's easy enough to replicate once the market demands it in large quantities. A tile is a tile, and from what I can tell there's no cost advantage to making them in Buffalo with Tesla's process.

Getting to a place where solar companies are selling installs as hardware plus labor plus rational lean overhead is where we're headed next and again it's Tesla forcing a complacent market to make the clearly necessary changes. $2//W installs, $3500 Powerwalls, and a Tesla energy management subscription is where it's at.

ELDA has been OK the first few days we had it, but up in the mountains there is lots of narrow roads with only one lane in total (bi-directional) with no center markings. The speed limit is mostly 50mph/80kmhThere are side-markings, and there is some extra space outside the side markings. The idea is that you try drive in the right side of the only lane, and then go a bit outside the side markings when meeting another car. With ELDA enabled, this can soon become deadly in my view.. When meeting a car, I would try to steer slightly outside of the right side-markings of the road, as would the car from the opposite direction. If there was high grass or boulders on my side of the road, the car would start beeping loudly and try to steer directly into the oncoming car! After two near-death experiences, I disabled ELDA. I also disabled it on our way back home. I will now have to rember to disable this dangerous feature every time we drive on these kinds of roads..

If the car knew that it was in a ""single lane/bi-directional road"" it should disable this feature automatically. But I don't think the poor Model 3 even knows this. I'm OK with the AP being ""beta"", but Tesla should really test mandatory emergency features better before release..",,0,0,0,0

2. He drives his engineers hard.
3. He lets his engineers explore (combined with #1 and #2 above, this is what you want)

Thank you to everyone who posted a reply. I appreciate your input.

I know there have been other posts on this question, but thought I would revisit it here. Some people say it is easier on the battery if you charge at a lower amp. But others say it is actually more wear and tear on the battery system because the total charging time is longer. To pick random numbers as an example, is it better to charge at 48 amps for 1 1/2 hours or at 30 amps for 2 1/2 hours? I was thinking of reducing my amp rate not so much for the car but more for the effect of the total amps available for the rest of the house. But come to think of it, which would be better for the car's charging system overall? Thank you.
""

In principle, slower charging is better for the lithium cells in the pack. However, all AC charging in a Tesla is slow enough that I doubt you'll see a meaningful difference.

Other systems like the charger module and coolant pumps will technically benefit from a shorter running time, though again I doubt you'll see a measurable difference in normal operation, and it may be offset by increased thermal cycling in the charger module.

The efficiency of the charger seems to be higher at higher rates.

Overall, it's not really a problem. The car is designed to handle it, and the differences in durability/reliability between AC charge rates are unlikely to matter for the life of the car.",,0,0,0,0

Musk is poopooing lidar because it’s espensive, not because it doesn’t work... He has promised fsd to a lot of people with cars already on the road and free retrofits to lidar probably not an option....

until he proves he doesn’t need lidar for FSD (including in situations like these) I think pointing out the lack of lidar is legitimate.
""

Actually, there is not a car on the road that can stop safely at those speeds when the stalled car is obscured by other (moving) traffic until the last second. It's not the sensors that stop the car, it's the software. And phantom emergency braking creates more problems than it solves which is why even cars with LIDAR have limited ability to stop suddenly at freeway speeds. LIDAR has so many false positives that current systems cannot brake for all of them without being completely unsafe. Which is why there are no FSD cars on the market (LIDAR or not). 

This has nothing to do with cost and everything to do with the current state of FSD systems.",,0,0,0,0

It would also be good to see charging sessions outside SC but I’m guessing that would be API or teslafi .
""

Getting a little OT but @Allx made a statement which I can answer .

Well I can only speak for ChargePoint sessions, as that's what I use at work, but that app does keep track of all charging activity. I rented a Model 3 off turo.com back in Jan. 2018 and the app still shows those charging sessions under the Charging Activity link. The location of the station, the estimated amount of range added, the duration of the charge and the date and cost are shown in a scrolling list in reverse chronological order (i.e., newest charges first). There's also a graphic that shows your cost and optionally, the amount of energy delivered to the car and the estimated distance, for the month that's at the top of the list.

If you click on any of the individual charging sessions you'll see a line graph showing the date and time of the session, the amount of power delivered in a timeline, the cost, duration and total amount of power consumed for the session. An estimated amount of range is also shown, based upon whatever vehicle you have registered with the ChargePoint account.

I'm not sure what else that's important enough to be recorded. There's also a Trends section where you can see a bar graph over time that can display either your cost, the energy consumed or the distance provided for each month of activity. Of course none of this will account for charging losses and/or vampire drain but I figure it's next to nothing when looking at months worth of data. I don't know if or when any of this data will go away but like I said, my initial ChargePoint sessions on the rental 3 are still there.

I'm not trying to sound like a ChargePoint advertisement but it's the best public EV charging network for me, for where I live. Yes, they only offer Level 2 charging for the 3; the DC Fast stations still can't be used with the CHAdeMO adapter with the 3.

The more supercharging you do the more battery degradation you will get. So your already shorter range battery will get even shorter faster.
""

Supercharging would be very rare. Only for trips that we don’t use the Tiguan for, which would exclude winter trips to Tahoe, or trips where we need to take the kid + 75lb sheepdog. Specific trips I might take would be: LA for work, maybe once a year; Vegas for Work, again maybe once a year; Napa when my wife and I can get away on our own for a day or two; and then the aforementioned stab at cross country, maybe once every 2 years.

I won’t even need to charge at home. We get free Level 2 charging at work.

This is the hell I’ve been putting myself thru, and honestly I’m glad I’ve had this much time to think about it. I’m trying to be very pragmatic about what this car is for. At the same time I’m imagining how much I’ll WANT to drive the car on longer trips. Part of the reason I’m backing away from the Model Y - it would be a compromise in most respects as a long-range family vehicle than the Tiguan - and so I may be saving my marriage by not constantly have the fight with her about which vehicle to take! 

I think honestly the best case for spending the extra $$ now would be long term value. At least I think today “Long Range” is going to stand up to better scrutiny in a few years as range and charging performance continues to improve.",,0,0,0,0

It should be noted that almost all automotive leather, and ""vegan"" leather should be cleaned and treated in the same way because almost all automotive leather has a polyurethane coating, which is what vegan seats are made out of.
This is why leather conditioner on automotive seats is a waste of money because it cannot penetrate into the actual leather. It just sits on the surface until your clothing absorbs it. A notable exception is on perforated leather seats where the liquid conditioner can actually come in contact with the leather hide and help keep it pliable.

To minimize this from happening you might consider having Opti-Guard Leather installed. It was designed for this exact purpose. See the video I made about it below.

However, to clean your seats effectively and safely in the meantime, use the lightest cleaner possible and work your way up in strength as needed. Too many people pull out the big guns first and either damage their seats or scrub too hard and damage the stitching. Also realize the some blue dyes are permanent so you might only be able to lighten the stain. Know when to stop. If the following method does not work, just stop and either live with it or contact a certified IDA Professional in your area.

This is the order we professionally clean blue-jean dyed white Tesla seats:
Opti-Coat No Rinse diluted 255:1 (one ounce in 2 gallons of water)
Opti-Coat Fabric Clean and Protect straight from the bottle
Opti-Coat Power Clean diluted with 9 parts water.
With each step just dampen a microfiber towel with the product and scrub lightly, being mindful of the raised stitching on the side bolsters. Let the product do the work, not your muscles.
Those Opti products are only available from certified Opti installers or from the links I provided.
Good luck!

11thIndian, did you account for the efficiency ratings for each vehicle? This may add additional stops to your trip. I have the LR AWD 19"" which yields ~ 80% based on my driving experience. I've made a couple of trips from VA to GA (567 mi, 1way). My last trip there, I didn't plan. Seven stops and $80.12 of supercharging made me wish I had a longer range vehicle. So, I drove the Odyssey last time down. The energy cost was cheaper too. I'm holding out for the Rivian 400mi range p/u.
just my two cents
""

This was all done via abetterroutplanner.com, which people say is a more accurate gauge than Tesla’s own planner, so I’m taking their calculations as ‘fair’. 

The Rivian is definitely growing in my mind as the Tiguan replacement in a few year, though it may be a touch bigger than I might like - but I have to see it in person. I wish there was a place they listed where it is available for viewing. though they say the R1S is going to start at $73K, I’m sure the longer range battery will be pushing it into the $90K’s.",,0,0,0,0

What? I have driven that section many many times. It is a fork that splits two highways, 121 and 114. There is no way for AP to know to take left fork or right, as both of them have 65 as speed limit at that point.

Having said that it is puzzling, that why can't AP always default to the straight section, which in this case is the right fork 114). Or let the algo always follow one line when in doubt - either right or left . I prefer the left line, as this will eliminate the dive to right side exits.

That is the point I am making also, it has to either take left or right. Middle of the road braking is no good. That is what happened to me, I had to take over quickly to go left in this case.

3695756,SR+ vs LR RWD. How much more pain on a long trip?,Matt L,2019-05-27 10:31:00,"11thIndian said:
↑

I'm still waiting on paperwork before I can trade in my current car for a Model 3.

In a ""money not an issue"" scenario of course I'd go for long range. But my family wants to travel, and since the Model Y doesn't look like it's going to be the replacement for our Tiguan I thought it would, I've decided to get a Model 3 as our local commuter until a good replacement does present itself (Rivan RS1 or VW I.D. BUZZ are possibilities).

That being the case I've had it in my mind to go with the SR+; the 240mi, even with the general range reductions applied (charge to 90%, heating/AC, etc) will be plenty for my drive to work (8mi each direction). And even short trips to Monterey, Napa, or Tahoe from the Bay Are will need no to 1 charging stop.

But of course the allure of long range is always nagging at me. So I decided to use A Better Route Planner to do an experiment. Next Summer I may decide to drive back home to Ontario for a couple of weeks. How much more inconvenient is it to do this trip in a SR+ vs a LR RWD. Bay Area CA to Hamilton ON is 2647mi.

In the end I ran the numbers for the whole gambit of vehicles just to see what the spread looks like.

SR
24 Stops • Charge Time 11:24 • Trip Time 52:46

SR+
23 Stops • Charge Time 9:54 • Trip Time 51:03

MR RWD
21 Stops • Charge Time 8:17 • Trip Time 49:08

LR AWD 19”
20 Stops • Charge Time 7:58 • Trip Time 48:29

LR RWD 19”
19 Stops • Charge Time 7:38 • Trip Time 47:57

LR RWD 18” Aero
19 Stops • Charge Time 6:49 • Trip Time 47:07

So between the 2 vehicles I was considering, on a basically cross-country trip, the LR RWD saves you just about 3 hours in charge/trip duration time. Way less than I was expecting. Even with the 18"" aeros, its only 4.

Going down to the SR adds an additional hour and a half to the spread.

So this was a useful exercise for me. Is the 7K more $$ for the LR RWD worth it for 4 hour difference maybe once a year? Or even once every 2 years?

At this point no. I think the spread will widen once V3 chargers are along this route, since the SR+ won't be able to achieve the 250Kwh rate of the full size battery. Right now there's only guesses (some think the in the 170's).

Anyway, in case anyone else is balancing on this particular edge, maybe this post will be useful to you as well.
""

Overly simplistic comparison. Someone else mentioned the shorter trips that you would have to charge for that the LR wouldn’t but also, don’t forget that the LR charges faster than the SR. It does so on V2 superchargers but will be dramatically faster on the V3s.

And other than Range the LR comes with many more options. The LR RWD I still think is the best value. (If you don’t need AWD)",,0,0,0,0

Everything worked properly with it, but I had the Pioneer unit that I preferred. The Pioneer has Apple Car Play and a few other features I liked. So I swapped the unit in (makes it sound so easy!), and have a few issues with it.


First, of course the wiring for the Roadster is difficult to figure out as it does not seem to use any conventional color-coding. Second, the unit had the Alpine “direct connect” backup camera which uses a 6-pin harness instead of the usual RCA plug. The GPS antenna uses a different plug, as does the microphone. So be prepared if you are going to do something like this to do a lot of head-scratching. The issues:


As with any head unit, there is a lead for constant 12V and a lead for switched 12V (plus the ground of course). It took me hours to try and sort out why the wires from the car harness had the switched and constant 12V when measured, but the radio would not work when they were hooked up. It worked fine on the bench with a power supply hooked up. After a lot of measuring I found that the 12V constant power would drop to 2-3 volts when connected to the radio; why, I have no idea. If I jumpered across the 2 power supply leads then the radio worked fine. I didn’t know if this would do any harm but it seemed to work OK; and yes, it does power off when the car is shut down. The only issue is that when the car is started each time the radio is like it is booting up for the first time and goes through a couple of initial start-up screens, so this is not something I can live with. Is there something in the 12V constant power lead that is limited in some way? Can’t remember off-hand if it is the green or brown wire (1 is the constant power and the other is the switched). Is there another source for the 12V constant power I could try?


Second issue. The camera itself works when “rear view” is selected on the radio, but does not go into it automatically when in reverse. I’ve got it set on the menus for “power” as opposed to “ground” for camera trigger, but tried both. Pretty sure I measured the leads and found the one that had 12V when in reverse and nothing (or very low voltage) when in drive. But I must have this one wrong somehow.


The last issue is one that I’ve seen mentioned many times. How do you get the USB cable from the head unit to the rear of the console? I’ve searched and found bits and pieces of information on removing the console, but nothing that worked for me. I took the cover off the back of it (the traction control panel) and saw where the cable goes in. It would not pull out at all and seemed to come from the lower part of the console, not the upper part; when the console was loose at the back and I wiggled it the cable did not move. I took out a bunch of screws that I could see but nothing actually helped remove the console to see the cable run. I’ve seen it mentioned that the cable runs just under the transmission shift buttons, but like I said it seemed that mine was running under the lower part of the console. People putting in sound insulation must be removing the whole console, no?


So if anyone has any suggestions for any of this feel free to post.

thank you in advance,

When the throttle is wide open, you have a 100% vacuum leak to the atmosphere and power brake assist only works on the first try.

I guess they are making this symmetrical for switching over to British/ Japanese markets. New door cards with pockets, Trim that wraps from the dash to around the doors. New seats. this should tie in when the drivetrain refresh comes out in about two months. The active suspension will not be constant electro magnet ( eats up too much juice) but rather settings on the air suspension for sport, comfort etc. There will be new headlights and taillights but sitting in the same nacels. There will be active aero for the rear wing and on the front bumper. The new computer will be massively more powerful for the self driving functions.

OK, got 2019.12.1.2, tested things, and I believe the browser has a bug with requesting the user permission to use the location data.

What I see is that if the browser is already running, and you bring up TeslaWinds.com, the browser will not ask the user for permission to use the location data, and what you'll see in the browser is that the wind and elevation data won't load (it will show 0.0 for wind direction, and -1000 feet for elevation).

What you can do at this point is close the browser window completely using the X in the upper left corner. Once it's closed, then open it again, and the site will reload, and now the browser will ask for your permission to use location data. Click Allow, and then the site will load and run normally.

I think you can use this procedure for any site that needs location data, like TeslaWaze. If this bug shows up there, TeslaWaze will load the bottom controls (gear icon for settings, + and - icons for zoom), but will not load any map tiles. Close the browser, open it again, the page reloads, the prompt for location data permission comes up, click Allow, then the site works normally.

Tesla will need to fix the bug in the browser code, but until then you can use this work-around for any site that needs location data.

It's absolutely paramount for market participants to be transparent in my opinion. Nontransparent entities are high risk because you essentially invest into them based on just faith (which is absolutely the case with Tesla, BTW). This is why security regulations exist, but they were created long time ago when it was hard to disseminate information. It's much easier nowadays so companies should look into being more transparent than regulations require, not less.

Also consider that it's much easier to twist lack of information than it is to twist trusted information. Information vacuum filled with gossip and speculation is a very fertile grounds for all sorts of lies dissemination. And this is obviously bad for investors.

...
At high temperatures, your curves look approximately correct. As our degradation modes at high temperature are primarily related to SEI growth and electrolyte decomposition, the dependance on temperature is related to the rate of [undesired chemical] reaction, hence varies roughly as per the Arrhenius equation, which is roughly as you've indicated.

At low temperature, degradation is typically more around mechanical stress, unless we get to very very low SoC (think parking at 0% SoC and leaving the vehicle for a long time). The mechanical stress is caused by the movement of the lithium ions, and as the lithium ions move more easily at higher temperatures, your stress intensities may actually reverse in their temperature relation at low SoC. The impact of the mechanical stress will depend upon the type of cell, cell design and cathode chemistry, hence it is difficult to generalise for all EVs. It is also worth noting that when the cell is new, the anode is designed to have greater capacity than the cathode and the electrolyte holds an excess of cyclable lithium. As the anode excess and cyclable lithium reduce, the mechanical stress at low SoC will become greater. The storage stress at low SoC should also be much lower than at high SoC - roughly 40-50% but depends upon many factors and will change through life! Sorry for the non-definitive answer....
""

@EV-Tech Exp In mechanical components subject to cyclic temperature loads, thermo-mechanical fatigue (TMF) results in loss of stress carrying capacity - the mechanism seen here include cracking and exfoliation (similar to Li-Ion batteries). Since these temperature and/or SoC cycles in Li-Ion batteries lead to capacity loss, the natural question is:

Has anyone (in your school or lab) done any studies on TMF-like models for these batteries in order to understand the effect of the temperature + SoC cycles? The intent would be to find optimal operating conditions that extends the life of the battery.
If Tesla knows that high temperatures is not good for the battery (as when the car is parked in direct sun in hot areas), why not do active cooling even when the car is parked? Or do they?

At such production rates the market for ride sharing could be satisfied rather quickly. Especially if not the whole world is on board allowing a car to make a driver with a job redundant. A simple little law that every vehicle needs a licenced designated driver will ruin RoboTaxi and all competing initiatives.
All they do is try and replace one or more jobs per commercial vehicle on the road. Sure there are costs to be saved, but to use such a business model (pushing millions of low wage workers into unemployment, as would Tesla's production accomplish) to market the very pinnacle in automotive tech...seems a waste. And for now, it's actually a stretch.

When there are multiple FSD operations live, it will be a good time to still have a market of people who will actually drive their next car. Tesla seems ready to alienate all customers away from them.

Yes - something to be considered.

Currently there are a million Uber, Lyft drivers and likely they are the first ones to get replaced.

I really wish people would stop telling others that salvaged = dangerous. Salvaged only means the repair cost was too high ( there are a lot of variables and I wont get into it ). Think about what would happen if someone stole your car and removed all the glass, interior, bumpers and lights. Yup, it would be considered totalled/salvaged even though there was no damage done to the car structure itself. Replace all the missing parts and you have a perfectly safe vehicle with a salvaged title. If the welds were shotty then it was not repaired at a reputable shop and that's on the buyer for not doing there homework about the history and repairs done.

If the op car was repaired at a reputable shop then I would look into that shop to see what all was done to it and if in fact they replaced any sensors or other pertinent items that could be deemed at fault. But but but, it's on the purchaser to check the car out if it has a salvaged title so there will be no recourse to the person or shop that did the repairs.

I‘m also about to replace a set of old / failing solar panels with new ones... 

System specs: I have 52 165W panels installed in 2003, 8 of which I replaced in 2017 with 265W, and they feed four SMA Sunnyboy inverters, 2 each of 1800W and 2500W output.

On a sunny day my „nameplate“ rated 9.6KW system is currently producing about 41KWH. I expect it‘s really only a (reality) 6KWH system right now. By upgrading 32x165W panels (which I estimate are operating at 50-63% capacity) to 24x300W panels, I‘m hoping to get my panel output up to 10KWH (PTC) system.

Does this mean that PG&E is saying that they will accept no net power generation, if I have Powerwall units installed?

I can‘t tell if this means that my panel upgrade will be a bad idea, since PG&E will have „aged“ my old system somehow and won‘t let me feed back to the grid,
- or - 
If it means I should not install the PowerWall since with just 2 units (~13KWH capacity?) I will be dumping a ton of power into the ground.

↑

Overly simplistic comparison. Someone else mentioned the shorter trips that you would have to charge for that the LR wouldn’t but also, don’t forget that the LR charges faster than the SR. It does so on V2 superchargers but will be dramatically faster on the V3s.

And other than Range the LR comes with many more options. The LR RWD I still think is the best value. (If you don’t need AWD)
""

Charging speed for SR+ is definitely been something I’ve been following closely. Looks like even after the recent software updates, that SR cars only get about 101kw on V2. I don’t think anyone has tried an SR vehicle on V3, so it’s mostly speculation by a couple of users here. No doubt the LR is going to benefit much more once those are available in abundance- however long that takes.

Neen, de snelheid moet zo ingesteld worden voor de test dat aan die snelheid de laterale acceleratie aan die snelheid te hoog wordt. De test is geslaagd als desondanks (en zonder bestuurdersinput) de laterale acceleratie niet wordt overschreden.
""

Neen, er staat wel degelijk letterlijk: ""The vehicle shall be driven without any force applied by the driver on the steering control (e.g. by removing the hands from the steering control) with a constant speed on a curved track with lane markings at each side. The Technical Service defines a test speed and a radius which would provoke a higher acceleration than aysmax + 0.3 m/s2 (e.g. by travelling with a higher speed through a curve with a given radius).""

Nogmaals, met een beetje knippen: ""The vehicle shall be driven (...) with a constant speed (...) which would provoke a higher acceleration than aysmax"".

Niks ingestelde snelheid met mogelijkheid voor het systeem om te vertragen. Hij MOET met een vaste snelheid rijden, die zo gekozen is dat hij de bocht niet kan nemen met 3 m/s^2, en hij mag die 3 m/s^2 niet overschrijden, dus hij moet uit de bocht gaan. Dat is de test die moet gedemonstreerd worden. Auto slaagt als hij uit de bocht gaat, en faalt als hij de bocht wel neemt. Dat laatste staat er niet letterlijk, maar is de enige logische conclusie die consistent is met de testvoorwaarden. Als hij afremt, is ""with a constant speed"" niet voldaan. Als hij niet afremt maar wel de bocht neemt, is de laterale acceleratie te hoog.

Nogmaals, dit is maar een test, en ik veronderstel dat de constructeurs er in principe voor gaan proberen zorgen dat de auto op tijd afremt, maar aangezien autosteer zich af en toe wel eens durft misrekenen, kan dat dus mis gaan en mag het systeem in dat geval niet scherper sturen en moet het dus in plaats daarvan plots hard remmen en/of uitschakelen en/of uit de bocht gaan, allemaal bijzonder onveilige oplossingen.",,0,0,0,0

So, will Tesla get back about half the sales volume with a refreshed S? think so. As to the X, it'll lose some to the Y for sure. Same exact idea.

I actually think the Y is far more likely to cut into the sales of the 3 and S rather than the X. It’s a lot closer to those 2 cars in functionality than the X.

Dat doet hij niet. Dat doet ie alleen wanneer je airco of verwarming aan staat. De boordcomputers draaien niet vanaf de AC lader.

Als de accu vol is en de auto dicht toont die LED dat de relais open zijn (geven geen 230V door). Doe je de deur open en moet de kachel aan, dan zet de auto het laden aan (en de paal sluit z'n relais)

Staat je climate control in de auto uit en de accu is vol dan neemt de auto geen vermogen op uit de paal. Er staat dan ook geen spanning op de laadkabel.

The only way I'll know for sure that Tesla is stepping up to the plate and continuing to do the right things is if they take care of their customers with this yellow screen of death problem. I've just got to believe Tesla will fix this mess and do it with a real solution and not a bandaid.

In other threads on TMC, people have reported that Tesla has told them they are not going to replace and/or fix the yellow bands of death on their screens under warrantee. This is very concerning to me. I have been living with this problem for six months and it has yet to be fixed. This problem cropped up before the car was one year old (I took delivery in 1/2018).

Not wanting to take this too far off-topic, but this just goes to show how different people are when it comes to preferences.
I don't know a single person who would rather have an S over a 3 at the moment. Especially the interior is far superior in the 3 imho. Much sleeker design, far more useful features, and - at least to people of my build - more interior room. I always felt cramped in the Model S, especially due to the abysmal headroom in the back. Everything felt tight and much smaller than what one would expect from a car this large. Total opposite on the 3, which to me feels much roomier even though it is smaller from the outside. Headroom is much better and legroom is comparable. Only in terms of cargo volume does the S dwarf the 3. Yet for most people, and at least all of those I know, the interior as well as storage space in the 3 is more than ample. Add to that the much better value for money, and the decision becomes a no-brainer...
""

While I won't argue that the S is a better value for the money than the 3, my S is for road trips and I greatly prefer the larger vertical display and IC in the S — I really dislike the smaller horizontal screen in the 3. I also can fit a full length air mattress in my S for camping and the hatchback makes it really easy to get in and out:



So, there are some of us who prefer the S. Not that I could afford a new one — I bought mine used and have been averaging more than 32.000 km (20,000 miles) a year on it.

There is zero advantage to hardware 3.0 over 2.5 until Tesla releases software that can take advantage of the new hardware. I doubt they will release such software until they are ready to upgrade the hardware on all cars who purchased FSD. So, sometime by the end of this year or the beginning of next year Tesla will release new software compiled specifically for version 3.0. Cars without the new hardware will not be able to take advantage of the new features and capabilities in the new software.
""

TLDR - I'm happy my Model 3 was delivered with HW3, despite the fact that it's a little behind HW2.5 on a few features and firmware update priority.

----

Yeah I think Telsa was in a little bit of an impossible position from a communications perspective on this HW3 transition. They couldn't NOT announce that they had starting installing the new computer in new builds because people are going to start digging into them and finding it; not to mention the fact that HW3 doesn't yet have feature parity with HW2.5 (no confirmation NoA).

But they also haven't been playing it up at all with hyperbole like ""If you buy one now you get this super awesome new computer that is so much faster and better!"" For anyone closely following Telsa's (and Elon's) statements on the subject, it's clear that it will be a while before the benefit of the new HW is even noticeable. It's unfortunate that anyone rushed to order a car with HW3 because they thought it would be immediately better than ones previously produced. But I guess that was inevitable with some buyers.

In my own case, it was Elon's statements that FSD would go up in price substantially over time that finally pushed me over the edge into ordering. Many seem to believe that was pure marketing (Hey! It worked with me!) but I'm not so sure. I wouldn't be at all surprised if right now is the low water price for FSD going forward. Particularly if they are able to deliver what they claim. It might not turn out to be Elon pulling a ""demand lever"" to get more orders.

I ordered my LR AWD on 4/15 and was assigned a VIN on 4/17. Until delivery I wasn't sure if it would have HW3 or if I was getting one that was produced before the switchover. Sure, I HOPED I would get the HW3, but not because I thought the car would be any better at delivery than the HW2.5 cars. I'd seen Elon's statements that features utilizing the new computer wouldn't be released until later in the year and they would update existing cars HW if you'd purchased FSD by the time that happened.

The reason I was happy that my car was delivered with HW3 is I'll be saved the stress of the computer swap out wait/scheduling when the time for the new FSD features starts to near. The trade off for that reduced stress is I don't get the ""no confirmation NoA"" up front and it seems like for at least the 2019.16.x update, I'm waiting a bit longer than most other Tesla owners. Well if I knew that all up front and was able to choose, I'd still choose to have the slightly limited functionality HW3 now and save the computer upgrade stress later.

But it doesn't mean I think I'll get FSD level features (or better AP quality) any earlier than people who have the HW2.5 cars. My hunch is there aren't as many people out there that have already purchased FSD waiting for an upgrade as many think. Before the EAP features were rolled into the FSD upgrade, I think far fewer people splurged for that upgrade. Anecdotally at least it seemed like lots of people wondered if there would ever be any value added that justified the price. They figured they could add the FSD later when/if the features were delivered. I highly doubt I would have gone for FSD if it didn't offer in the old EAP days. I suspect that change has significantly increased the number of people who go for the FSD package. You can get features today that aren't available with the standard AP. It's only been a few months of cars being sold without EAP where a higher percentage of people may have bought FSD. If that's correct, it might not take nearly as long to get through the upgrade backlog as many fear.

I'm excited and optimistic for was HW3 and FSD will bring, but the joy if driving this car, as it is today, FAR outweighs the inconvenience of limited features and slower firmware updates right now. Plus, this summer/fall as we start seeing the early leaks of videos with people trying FSD features, I'll sleep better knowing the hardware to do that is already sitting in my garage.",,0,0,0,0

↑

I took some time thinking in the hammock today. One thing that I realized is that a lot of assumptions regarding supervised neural networks are based on a single iteration on a constant dataset. But what Tesla has introduced is an iterative approach to building the dataset. Train an initial network, deploy it, gather incorrect predictions, label these(manually/automatically), add to dataset, retrain, deploy repeat.

Do we have any papers regarding how effective this method of making neural networks is at tasks such as image classification? We have this paper: Billion-scale semi-supervised learning for image classification but here it seems their way of adding more data is by adding the easy part of the new dataset rather than the hard part like what Tesla is doing.

Like Karpathy said, if there is a signal the network will [in theory] find it given enough [hard] data.
""

Wonder the same. At some point the network has to ""average out"" and cannot accept more data of a type of event without reducing accuracy of other events. How close are they to this point now with AP2.5, and will that eventually be a limiting factor for HW3?

I guess Elon kinda confirmed that a larger neural network always equals better predictions as long as you got enough data for it. Which is why they work on HW4 now to chase those 9's in the accuracy. Lets just hope they get to the first 9 with HW3.",,0,0,0,0

Does your car have a salvage title? There are reports of Tesla removing supercharging once they are aware. With that being said there are also people who strongly disagree with Tesla doing that and can help you restore supercharging. However you will likely have to compensate them for their time.
""

This was actually bought from Tesla (had to go down to Houston from Dallas to pick it up at their location there), with regular title. I was worried a bit about the flood of flood-damaged cars down there, but I don't think this was likely in this case. I didn't think to ask about access to Supercharging. They mentioned it was available, asked how I planned to charge (since I'm about to move in several weeks, currently just using 110V at home, and Supercharger when available/needed), and didn't mention any upcoming or current need to pay for use of Superchargers. And used 2 on drive back from Houston to Dallas. Thinking I should have clarified more here with them, but maybe it's standard to continue access with cars bought from Tesla?

What is exactly the difference now between HW2.x and HW3? Is it just no confirmation NoA?
""

The other difference noticed is the dash cam videos are encoded with HEVC. That's caused some playback issues on Windows because the CODEC isn't built into the OS by default. I downloaded VLC on my Windows machine and that works fine. On my Mac there were not problems playing the videos with the stock OS video player.

Other than that I think it's pretty much the same. There are some bugs that might be HW3 specific that I and other people have run into. USB drive compatibility, GPS glitches (might not be specific to HW3), back up cam choppiness. Nothing that probably can't be fixed with software. The joys of being an early adopter.",,0,0,0,0

I am not aware of any rechargeable battery that will last a ""lifetime"". I have 8 laptops at the moment and only the three newest ones have working batteries. I just recycled the 3 oldest laptops and they also had dead batteries.

They can't use a section of the HVB to provide 12 volts. It would have to be at the bottom of the HVB. The potential between the 12 volt lead and the top of the HVB would be 388 volts (400 - 12). That would be extremely dangerous.",,0,0,0,0

I have a HW3 LR AWD car. Had this happen for a week or so on 2019.12.1.2. Multiple MCU reboots/resets didn't fix it. Then like magic it went away on it's own for some reason and haven't had a problem in the last few weeks. No update needed. Not sure why it corrected.

I was also having issues at the same time with the dash cam USB causing constant display freezes and reboots. USB drive seemed to be incompatible because removing that fixed the freezes and it's about that same time the GPS glitch went away so worth removing that variable and seeing if it fixes your problem. I bought another USB drive and for the last week I haven't had any issues with it in there.

If the USB isn't the issue, might be worth it for peace of mind if nothing else to put in a service request in the app. Or if you can just wait it out.

Thanks. I'll give it a few days to see what happens. 

I've had the USB drive in since I bought the car on 4/26 so I don't think that's the issue.

As mentioned in the original post (which I guess might have been a little too long): I have had nothing but fantastic customer service from Tesla in the past. I have contacted them regarding the yellow screen several times. I continue to have nothing but the highest regard for the people at my SC. 

What I heard from my SC was that a permanent fix is still being explored by engineering. The SC gave me no ETA for a repair. This is a worrisome situation since Tesla is selling brand new cars right now. Are they selling those cars with a known defect? If not, are they withholding a permanent fix for existing customers? I feel these are important questions.

Part of the reason I originally posted this information was to refute some of the rumors such as a software fix, which obviously would not work since the yellow is reflective and therefore both blocks the light from the screen and reflects sunlight hitting it.

Another reason for this post was to show that this yellowing can worsen into more than a cosmetic issue.

I am a staunch Tesla supporter and want them to succeed. I've driven electric since 2013 and will never go back. In my opinion, excellent customer service is just as important as manufacturing an excellent car. Relegating customers to stare at their yellowing screens for months or years on end, is not, in my opinion, the kind of customer service that will encourage future sales or glowing recommendations 
""

Well, when I had my S in last week, I was told that the ""fix"" was going to be some kind of liquid put on the screen (but the final fix wasn't firm and still under investigation). The service tech said it would be an owner's cost to replace the screen. All I can say is I hope this isn't true. I have doubts that some liquid applied with actually hold up. I suspect that part of the problem is that with the cashflow issues, and this would not be a cheap repair.

my family wants to travel, and since the Model Y doesn't look like it's going to be the replacement for our Tiguan
""

OK, I'll bite. How is the Model Y not going to be as good a road-tripping vehicle as the Tiguan? We do a LOT of road-tripping and our Model 3 hauls all four of us and all the same stuff we used to haul in our Touareg. Considering the Tiguan is SMALLER than the Touareg and the Model Y will be LARGER than the Model 3 is, you've lost me. Also, the sound system, NAV system, autopilot, smoother drive, lack of noise/vibration etc. all add up to making the road trip FAR more relaxing and enjoyable in the Tesla than in an ICE SUV.

Here are some tips on packing the Model 3. 

Most importantly: ditch the suitcases. Duffels make for a far better usage of space. They can be squished into any space available, including the frunk. Suitcases are not malleable and often have protrusions like the wheels. They leave a LOT of wasted space around them.
Be sure to use up the space below the floor of the trunk. In fact I just leave the removable floor dividing the two spaces at home when on a road trip - then you won't have wasted space if your items don't perfectly fill the under floor space.
I like to put all the ""car things"" in the frunk (tire repair kit, tire inflator, charge cable kit, etc.) as well as a large duffel we have that fits the remaining space perfectly when the duffel about 80% full. This makes it easy to access the car things when needed without having to unpack much of the trunk to get at them due to the smaller size and shallower depth of the frunk.
Unfortunately the smallish trunk opening means that it doesn't accept large items very well. I have had to fold down the rear seat to stuff larger items (e.g. my recycling bins) into the trunk from there and put the rear seat back up, best again to use smaller duffels to fill the car.
We regularly use a roof box, we did with the Touareg too. It's far easier to get items out of and into the roof box when mounted on a car than on an SUV!
Confession time: for our week-long ski trips the car is loaded with no spare space left. The roof box now has all our skis and poles, as well as two peoples' bags of helmets and boots. With the Touareg we used to fit all four bags of ski boots and helmets inside the SUV so truly the difference in size between the Model 3 and the Touareg is 2 ski boot/helmet bags. Also, a little more effort is required to fit everything inside the Model 3 whereas I just tossed bags into the back of the Touareg. Technically I do haul ""all the same stuff we used to haul in our Touareg"" but two of the ski boot/helmet bags have shifted to the roof box.

As another point of data, last summer my 2 boys, my father and I went on a fishing trip off the West Coast of Vancouver Island. The rental vehicle we used on Vancouver Island was a Jeep Grand Cherokee Ltd. I kind of forgot we'd have to bring fish back with us! We had 150 lbs of halibut and salmon packed in 3 coolers to bring home with us. On the way back to the airport, the SUV was stuffed to within a couple of inches from the roof. I worried about fitting it all into my Model 3 so we could get back home from Edmonton Intl Airport. Turns out the coolers fit perfectly in the trunk of the Model 3 (definitely caught a lucky break there) and we managed to fit all our bags in the frunk, under trunk space and the remaining space in the trunk.",,0,0,0,0

↑

But this is not the only difference.
Real life example trips.
130 miles to camp (with no charging). 260 mile RT. LR - home with 40 left. SR+ - divert to supercharger 40 mins out of way. Adds 1 hr to 2.5 hour return trip.

Easter trip to inlaws - 150 miles one way. It was cold and I drove fast so I did a 5 min stop at a supercharge. It would have been 25 min in a SR+.

Drove RT to pick up son 120 miles away. Doable in an SR+ with driving slow. Speed limit is 70 for most of the way so it is nice to not worry about it.

I have a 70D that now has a 220 range. We got an LR 2 months ago. So I have experience with both ranges.

Going to mountains to drop son off at Camp in July - 285 miles away. If I can get destination charging (we are staying overnight nearby) - then no SC stops. If not, I will make a stop or 2. With an SR+ - there is definitely a stop and possibly 3.

It is wickedly more common to make 200-300 miles trips than cross country trips. Then the difference can be stop or no stop. And when the SC is out of the way, it can be a big deal.

Lastly (I promise) - degradation. Our 70D has gone from 240 to 220 at 73k miles. It will be serviceable for a long time. But the range gradually becomes more of an issue.
""

This is probably the best example of the difference between an LR RWD and something else. It's not the cross country trips, it's the way more common medium range trips where you get to skip charging vs. a shorter ranged car. Most will probably consider flying when the distance starts to exceed 500 miles one way unless you have unlimited time and like to drive. So, the LR with two charges can make a 500 mile round trip, but anything else is going to take twice the number of stops. Another point to consider is that an LR that is driven at less than 70 mph could well exceed 310 miles one way. In my state I can go 60 mph in the truck lane (that's as fast as they can go as well) if I want to really maximize my range.",,0,0,0,0

I had this exact same problem begin on Monday 5/6, no amount of rebooting would fix it. I tried doing a full shut down but as far as I can tell that is not possible (even if I wait a couple of minutes after hitting the shut down button in the service tab, and the screen, ac, and interior lights go dark, as soon as I put my foot on the brake the car is on nearly instantaneously without any boot sequence evident).

Chatted with Tesla service, they scheduled me to bring the car in that Friday, 5/10. Thursday I was contacted by a member of the remote diagnostics team. He looked at the logs and said he ""could see some issues"". Friday morning, autopilot and cruise were back as if nothing had ever happened. I don't know if they did a remote reboot or if the autopilot just rebooted on its own, or some other magical fix. I asked and the technician said ""No really there is no reset you can do, just the autopilot computer performed a sleep cycle and reseted."" He also added that I can always try a scroll wheel reset but they didn't yet know enough about the problem to know whether that would help. He said to not bother bringing the car in for the appointment but to not cancel the reservation just in case. A few days later I got a text from him with an apology and the message that ""Unfortunalety there is no fix for the issue just yet but our engineers are working on a firmware version that will bring a fix to this issue.""

Autopilot kept working just fine - until this morning. The problem is back. I pulled my USB drive and rebooted - no dice. I tried a shutdown and waited a few minutes and had the same disappointing experience that left me thinking no actual shutdown of anything had occurred. Chatted with Tesla support just to let them know the problem has reoccured and gave them a message to pass along to the remote technician.

So it looks like I'll have to actually drive my own car on the freeway with my own two hands and full attention for the next week until the autopilot decides to ""perform a sleep cycle and reset"" or until the firmware update hits, whichever comes first. For what it's worth I'm on HW 2.5.

For what it’s worth, I had the same symptoms as my earlier posts happen again after the 12.1.2 re-push. Given that it’s the holidays I couldn’t get ahold of anyone at Tesla aside from emergency road service who couldn’t help. 

Some quick googling revealed a Tesla service note for cameras and radar alignment that referenced the ECU. I deduced that pulling the negative cable of the 12v battery may do a hard reset of the affected computer. Lo and behold, 5 minutes later the AP is back and registering vehicles.

An oncoming car had slowed to a stop or nearly stopped. Then it turned left, crossed our path and entered a driveway. It was far enough away that had it stopped in the middle of my lane I would have had time to stop without using maximum braking force. I let it go without braking at all and I did this pretty much unconsciously. This is what I think my computer (brain) did in this situation:

* Oncoming vehicle detected in left lane ahead, stopped or nearly stopped. Unusual, so dedicate an additional 200,000 neurons to monitor this.
* Vehicle advanced into my lane and is headed straight for me. Path of vehicle is curved and projected path and speed will take it out of a collision threat if it continued. Watch closely.
* Computed time to collision if vehicle stops in my lane is 4.8 seconds. Maximum braking time for full stop to avoid collision is 3.2 seconds. Waited 1 second before applying brakes to see what vehicle does.
* Vehicle continued along its projected curved path, still partially in my lane but now the vehicle cannot stop in my lane due to its forward speed and its reasonable braking power.
* Continued driving without braking.

There was no collision or threat of collision and passenger remained calm. If I was using TACC it would have panicked at the first sign that the oncoming vehicle was in my lane (dumping that bag of groceries in the back seat and prompting a scream into my right ear), regardless if the vehicle was on a path that would take it out of a collision threat within time for my car to brake to a full stop. I'm not saying ""if I can do this why can't Tesla"", but I am puzzled as to why this seems to be so difficult. Tesla does so many other things that require some heavy computin' so why not this? It's got the required information to do so.

Pretty pumped!

Got my new SR last week. Went to Boundary Waters for 10 days and just got back.

Last went in car at 5pm on 5/17. Car had 181 miles of range.

Just checked it, 2pm 5/27, 167 miles of range.

So that is about 10 full days, only 14 miles of range loss! 14/240/10= .00583 or 0.58% range or 1.4 miles per day lost. Not bad!

Here is what I did. This is my first experiment so nothing else to compare to and no idea how much of this made a difference at all yet.

1. Unplug phone charging cables.
2. 'turn car off' after opening door to get out but before closing it.
3. did not lock car
4. car sat in unheated/uncooled garage probably ranging from temps of 40-80.
5. never checked app/disabled mobile access
6. turned off wifi before exiting car
7. disable cabin overheat
8. HVAC system off
9. nobody around car with bluetooth connection
10. alarm off
11. all data sharing off
12. zero third party apps ever installed
13. windows open

Possibly turned some other things off I forgot about. Remind me?

It's a lot to do in order to decrease the drain, but could be worth it in certain situations. I think next I'm going to try everything the same but lock the car with the alarm on and see if it makes a difference. Have another 10 days trip coming up in a couple weeks so I'll have very similar conditions. Not sure if I can lock the car though without it turning back on, aka wifi etc. coming back on after exiting?",,0,0,0,0

Auto Lane Change without confirmation worked smoothly to pass a semi truck. Both the lane change into the left lane and then the lane change back into the right lane after I passed the truck were smooth. The driving part on the highway was great. 

When I got to my exit, NOA did suggest 2 incorrect lane changes on the screen. First, about a second before taking the exit, NOA suggested a left lane change (?) which would have moved into the left passing lane not the exit lane on my right. Then about a second after NOA steered me into the exit lane, NOA again suggested a left lane change (?) which would have taken me back on the highway instead of staying in my exit. Now, NOA did steer me correctly into the exit lane and correctly steered me in the off ramp, it just suggested bad lane changes but did not do them. 

It is worth noting that this exit had some serious construction work not too long ago. In fact Google Maps still shows the old exit. So I suspect this is a maps issue, not a NOA issue per se. If the map is off, it would explain why NOA was recommending incorrect lane changes. I definitely have not had this experience with other exits.

No issues, took my time and it took 45 minutes. Paper instructions in the box concerning tightening is now the same as the online version: 8 Nm +/- 1.

One thing to mention is the anti-abrasion tapes are completely covered by the pads. One of the first video of the install I saw, the tapes were way bigger than the pads so I guess they have now change that and after the install is finish you do not see the tapes at all, so looks great.

Did a quick consumption test on a 30 km total highway loop at 100 km/h and came with 3.9% increase.

The ""hum"" when parked and off is the battery warming up.
He says cars driven in ludicrous mode tend to hear a lot of fan and hum since the battery heats and cools so much.

3696010,Seattle to Mt St Helens trip,skdarkknight,2019-05-27 12:05:00,"Just wanted to post this hoping it will help someone else...

We are a family of 4 and our car is a 2015 Model S 85. We decided to visit Mt St Helens on 5/26/2019 and thought we will give the Model S a try. Generally we take the gas SUV on such trips but I was confident the Tesla could do it.

So here is more context:
Car has 22K miles on it as of today.
Car charged to 100% the before night.
Total body weight for 4 of us: 430 lb
Other weight due to electronics / camera / gear / jackets / water / snacks, etc: 20 lbs worst case
Outside temperature: 65 at start location and 60 at end location with 60-75 weather on the freeway
Start Location: Mill Creek, WA (98012)
Destination: Johnston Ridge observatory (98649) with multiple stops in between
Total distance each way: 188 miles
Car was on auto pilot 90% of the time
Car has non standard 22"" wheels. With the regular 18"" / 19"" / 21"" it will only be better.
AC was on 100% of the time and the temp was set to 65F constant.
All electronics were in use - with 2 cell phone chargers, an iPad charger and a Go Pro charger

Here are the battery consumption details:
1. From Home (100% battery) -> Centralia Supercharger (47% battery left)
- With an average speed of 65-75 mph due to different speed zones
- Distance covered was 112 miles
- Consumption was 337 Wh/mile

Charged battery to 100% at the supercharger while we were having lunch. Took about 50 min approx.

2. From Centralia Supercharger (100% battery) -> Johnston Ridge Observatory (49% battery left)
- With an average speed of 50-65 mph due to different speed zones (definitely over speeding)
- Consumption was about 530 Wh/mile till about 6 miles ahead of the observatory.
- Distance to be covered was 76 miles but we only went 70 miles approx and range anxiety set in. The observatory was 6 miles away and the battery indicated 49% left. We were uncomfortable and decided to return back.

We reached Centralia supercharger with 30% battery left.  The return back was mostly downhill and we didnt use the battery much. I didnt realize that. We should have easily gotten to the Observatory and more. But anyways, we had awesome time and saw some spectacular views as we made frequent stops in between. The view 6 miles before the observatory was just awesome.

Anyways we had dinner and the battery was charged to 100% again in about 45 min. Returned back home with 49% battery left after driving 112 miles.

So if you are wondering if you can make it to Mt St Helens Johnston Ridge Observatory from Centralia Supercharger and back, yes you can on a Model S 85 standard (non-dual motor). You will have about 20% battery left by the time you return.

Overall it was a comfortable trip. There was some range anxiety but it was unnecessary.",,0,0,0,0

Get used to your yellow. Unless you want to pay Tesla for a non-deteriorating screen (while in warranty, which they mark up and make a profit on) - get used to your yellow.

I'll call it what it is: Tesla engaging in bad-faith and being customer-antagonistic. I fully believe the new screens don't yellow; but to save money all Tesla has had to do is say ""No."" to current owners. (Note: It helps to be a youtube influencer, if you are, you may get your screen replaced.)

At this point everyone has a choice: Shell out for the new screen that absolutely by no question should be in warranty (except the fanboys who are going to tell me that the yellowing that started 90 days after getting my Model S is 'normal wear and tear and to be expected and unreasonable to ask for tesla to cover') -- or get used to the yellow. Because vinyl tape, firmware color filters, UV lights and now, to top it all off, a ""liquid they put on the screen"", is all just BS.

People are mad, but obviously not mad enough for it to matter. Wonder what the next ""coming someday!"" fix will be. Perhaps installation of a new bezel that will reduce the screen size to 14 inches! Get on it, Tesla!

I did my calculations again based on Tesla Bjorn's X P100D charging video and the charging power on the car's display is the power that is delivered by the charger, but it's not equal to the net charging speed. The display showed 110kW while the real charging speed was 100kW. At lower rates however, like around 50kW the difference was minimal (low currents, less heat loss).
""

I think it would be more accurate to say the car’s display is what the outboard charger is delivering to the BMS, but not the total power delivered from the outboard charger.

I believe Bjorn has one video at a hypercharger where he commented on the fact the accessory draw (heat/AC etc) was showing on the charger output but subtracted out from the charging display on screen. End of his Model 3 range drive video maybe?

Is the video you are referencing with accessories on or off?

You're right I don't understand the neural net - I was thinking of it as external to the car. That Elon is creating an army of robot cars that he will one day control.
""

That's a definite possibility - but not really related to the neural net. 

A neural net is a form of computer programming, implemented through a whole lot of matrix math. it takes a bunch of inputs, does a series of matrix math operations on them, and delivers outputs. 

Neural nets are a way of programming by system learning. Instead of the programming telling the system exactly what to do in every case,, you load the net, initialize random values, and then train it with good and bad inputs. Every time you train it, it adjusts the scaling factors of the matrixes to make the outputs look more like the trained good outputs and reject the trained bad ones. 

The final product of the training is a set of relationships between the inputs and outputs that gives the desired system response. That's then imbedded into the car's computers and the car uses it to make decisions - in this case, it takes camera inputs and decides if there are cars, trucks, bicycles, or pedestrians in the image (along with lane lines and road signs.) 

The image processing is all happening in the car's AP processor, using a neural net trained by the mothership and downloaded to the car. that image processing has to decide there's a car stopped (or moving slowly) in front of you, or the system logic won't allow TACC to engage below 18 mph.

Then after engaging TACC you have to have the car believe that vehicle is accelerating away with no odd indications and nothing to worry it for the car to start accelerating on its own in TACC - and even then, it accelerates pretty slowly and hesitantly.

This theory is even more improbable than a simultaneous failure on both sides of the pedal position sensor that causes it to show full accelerator, and as discussed above that's a really, really unlikely failure mode.",,0,0,0,0

Sorry I can't do that in any authoritative manner, as I no longer own my MCU1/AP1 Model S. I can say that people I know who still have such Teslas are generally not complaining, but that's not specific. When I hear just a few people making a big stink, I usually figure it's the people who are the problem, but that's not much to go on either. So I'll concede to your personal experience.

If you want to point me to a thread which discusses the differences between V8 and V9 for MCU1/AP1 or non-AP Teslas, I'll be happy to read and learn.
""

I am a Tesla lover. However, they do so much as a company, so differently it does defy logic. Their massive price adjusts on Model S and X with no meaningful refresh in sight. A loaded every option Model S is now $108k down from over $160K 2 years ago. I had a 2015 Model S with AP1, smooth as silk and SAFE. My AP2 ""FSD"" car is much more erratic with phantom braking and pulsing speed changes. My wife will NOT let me use Navigate on AutoPilot. I think it is cool, but TOTALLY lacks situational awareness. I have to intervene majorly everyday to prevent crashes or violent swerves. The software is not close to safe autonomous driving. It is an awesome enhanced cruise control and we, the public are willing Beta testers. This feature is one that Tesla needs to really regulate carefully, testing with test drivers and then the public. As other car companies push harder into EV's these could be bigger issues. I drove the Audi E-tron yesterday, amazing vehicle, quieter, incredible interior, better ""fun Tech"" (HUD, carplay, 3D top view cameras, blindspot, etc), but only 200 mile range, no real charging network and slower.

Yeah I'm not positive that the USB was causing my GPS issue, just wanted to the note the possible correlation. When I was seeing the GPS issue, the biggest problem was that Nav on AP was really freaky on the Interstate. It would suddenly think the car was on the service road with a 40MPH speed limit instead of 70MPH on the highway and brake hard. And NoA would oscillate between being enabled and disabled. Made it pretty unusable during the glitch.

If that logic is valid then the greatest damage would occur when the car is off and just sitting outside.

I was away for a week and my car was in the driveway; in that time the yellowing got a lot worse, but also just time seems to do it. Much of my yellowing occurred in the cold Colorado winter where the car never really got warm. Other people have said they've had them yellow while garaged for several months.

There's really no pattern to it, it seems. But just as a safety measure, since it seems that Tesla will never actually address this, (I may pay to have the screen replaced tomorrow when mobile service arrives to repair the MCU bezel they damaged at the last service) - I've been putting a towel over my screen when it's in the driveway.

Do they? ""lol, no, sucks to be you"" seems to be a satisfactory response so far; they do claim that the new screens don't yellow, but you have to pay for them.

The car drives perfect - feels a lot confident in corners when compared with the stock 18"" wheels that the car came with - I still have those in the garage.

However, there are 2 things:
1. The TPMS warning remains - it says tire pressure monitoring is not working because the supported configuration is only up to 21"". I took the car to the service center and they told me to ignore the message and that its not going to cause problems. They also told me they can remove the messaging for me but it will require about 2 hrs of work. I havent taken in the car yet for that to happen.
2. The ride is obviously stiffer. You will feel a lot more road than compared with the stock 18"" wheels which was definitely noticeably softer / cushiony (does this word exist)?

And I believe the power consumption per mile is also more with the 22"" wheels compared to the stock.

But having driven motorcycles, I dont car about the softer / firmer drive. I love the feel of the road and the looks... See for yourself...

↑

This is probably the best example of the difference between an LR RWD and something else. It's not the cross country trips, it's the way more common medium range trips where you get to skip charging vs. a shorter ranged car. Most will probably consider flying when the distance starts to exceed 500 miles one way unless you have unlimited time and like to drive. So, the LR with 2-3 charges can make a 1000 mile round trip, but anything else is going to take twice the number of stops. Another point to consider is that an LR that is driven at less than 70 mph could well exceed 310 miles one way. In my state I can go 60 mph in the truck lane (that's as fast as they can go as well) if I want to really maximize my range.

I asked about this on my 2017 90D and was told that you can pay (out of pocket) for an immediate replacement screen or wait for the software fix. This was last week. Truly feels like they can't get a good replacement screen that won't have the problem reoccur.
""

I suspect nothing except a replacement screen will be a permanent fix. Screens that can handle higher temps are available, and have been available in one form or another for decades. They are designed for tougher environmental applications: rugged notebook computers, outdoor signage, commercial, military, aerospace, and etc. etc. These displays are just more expensive than your average notebook computer display which is not designed for the 130F to 172F temps of a parked car in sunlight. So if temperature is the problem then it can be fixed. If sunlight UV is the problem then slap a UV filter over the screen.

I do not see how software can fix this kind of yellow band of death because it is reflective. The yellow will reflect ambient light such as sunlight overpowering the glow of the display behind the reflection. The reflective nature of the yellow band will also reflect back light from the screen i.e. filtering any light coming from the screen. So in engineering terms there is a double whammy working against any software fix.

I only have 12,000 miles on my car, keep it in a garage, and the screen looks this bad. My SC said it's the worst screen they have seen and yet it is not being immediately replaced. I am being told to wait and wait and wait. I've had this problem for six months. That's 1/3 of the time I have owned the car.

I do not believe Tesla is putting defective screens into new cars as they roll off the assembly line. That would be an ethical morass that could turn into a legal nightmare (lemon laws, bad press, and etc.). I've got to believe Tesla is smarter than that. So I suspect they have screens that will permanently fix or greatly mitigate the problem going into new cars.

After navigating a very tricky 43 ramps in 62 different directions section of highway flawlessly, NOA did two new things that impressed the crap out of me.

1. I was in lane two from the left of 6 lanes. Put the signal on to move one lane right. NOA prepared to move, had the blue line and then it suddenly went red, though no ‘cars’ appeared on the screen in neighboring lanes. 

I looked over my right shoulder and there’s a speeding SUV coming across multiple lanes from the right - but still two lanes over and behind me. The SUV hit the lane next to me just as it got beside me. 

I got the distinct impression my car had anticipated this would happen and thus why it held its lane until the SUV passed. In reality it likely picked up a fast moving object coming on a trajectory toward the space it wanted to go - or some such.

2. I was in the right most lane of 4 lanes. A new merge lane was forming to my right with two cars that were going to merge into my lane. There was a very short merge distance. My exit ramp was right after this merge ended. 

The two cars coming on the merge lane were close together. My car and those cars were going to meet at exactly the same time, causing my car to prevent both from being able to merge.

Just as I was about to disengage NOA to take over and yield to those cars, my car slowed enough to create my preset follow distance (7) and let those two cars merge in front of me seamlessly. It was like the car read my mind/knew my driving style.

Hallo mede Tesla rijders. Kreeg afgelopen vrijdag bericht dat ik as. vrijdag mijn M3 RWD kan ophalen in Tilburg.
Uiteraard moet ik 'm verzekeren. Ik volg deze draad al een tijd en heb al veel opties voorbij zien komen.
Graag roep ik jullie hulp in om een definitieve keuze te maken. Wellicht is er iemand die recent een verzekering heeft afgesloten?

Mijn omstandigheden zijn:
- eenmanszaak
- Auto zakelijk aangeschaft
- Verhouding aantal kilometers 40% zakelijk , 60% prive

Welke NL vezekeringsmij biedt de beste premie?

Ik ga morgen i.i.g. CB bellen (kan geen premie berekenen via de site)

Bij Charmeleon kom ik op 120,- p/m incl inzittenden verzekering en fiscale bijtellingsbeschermer.

Iemand nog gouden tips?

Bedankt alvast!
""

Ik heb mijn Model 3 LR AWD bij Centraal beheer (particulier) all risk verzekerd voor 85,— per maand. Wel met maximale no claim (42 jaar  ). Over de discussie zakelijk versus particulier verzekeren: de auto staat op de naam van een prive persoon en niet op de naam van een bedrijf (dat kan niet eens als eenmanszaak, want dat is geen juridische entiteit). Dat je de auto op de balans van de eenmanszaak zet, is puur een fiscale zaak en heeft geen enkele invloed op het schaderisico. Volgens mij heb je dus alle reden om hem als particulier te verzekeren. Anders zouden ze heldere definities moeten geven van zakelijk gebruik en particulier gebruik en die staan niet in de voorwaarden. Er worden alleen wat voorbeelden van zakelijk gebruik gegeven zoals taxi, personen of pakketvervoer en dergelijke.",,0,0,0,0

At 100 kWh per car. Probably closer to 65 kWh per car. They plan to make many ""affordable ID.3"" Golf sized/type cars with ~165 miles of EPA range with a battery pack much smaller than 100 kWh.

I see.
I don't have a lot of details. I think it is similar to the LAGER (Boeing) motor mentioned here (not the GTM), slide 12: http://images.spaceref.com/fiso/2015/071515_frank_eichstadt/Eichstadt-Jones_7-15-15.pdf
""

The motor used for the 3 and Semi is a switched reluctance permanent magnet (SWRPM) motor. That presentation doesn't mention the LAGER unit being reluctance type, and from the diagrams it appears to use a novel rotor/coil/stator layout. I believe they are different motor types, although the 3/Semi motor may also use Halbach arrays (conjentured in the Munroe teardown).

As @mongo has pointed out, not being an induction motor means the 3/semi motor doesn't have the eddy currents in the rotor for the bearings to deal with. In the Model S, ceramic bearings are indeed used, as are shaft grounding brushes to bleed off the current to avoid arcing past the ceramic bearings.",,0,0,0,0

Until I got my futuristic, cutting edge Tesla Model 3 two months ago, my daily driver was this 1951 MGTD MKII. It was REALLY my daily driver, drove from west coast Florida (VENICE) to San Francisco and also to Prince Edward Island. Some say I am crazy, or gutsy or BOTH. The MG motto is Safety Fast. It’s not so fast, 0 - 60 in 18 seconds, top speed 80.25 mph. My M3 SR+ does it (supposedly) in 5.3 seconds. Like no comparison but love both cars. Just have to remember to always use the brake on the MG. I have gotten so use to regenerative braking.

I think it would be more accurate to say the car’s display is what the outboard charger is delivering to the BMS, but not the total power delivered from the outboard charger.

I believe Bjorn has one video at a hypercharger where he commented on the fact the accessory draw (heat/AC etc) was showing on the charger output but subtracted out from the charging display on screen. End of his Model 3 range drive video maybe?

Is the video you are referencing with accessories on or off?

What method do you use to calculate “net charging speed”? Is 110kW in your example on the car’s screen, and 100kW is calculated (by what method?)

Thanks
""


In this video below watch the Tesla's power. 10kW can't be the accessories. 
At 16% 7:02s the charging speed shows 110kW and stays there until 46% 23:35s 
// timer is not the video timer but the charger timer shown in the video

Bjorn says the usable battery capacity is 92kWh.

92kWh*(46%-16%) = 27.6kWh
23:35 - 7:02 = 993 sec = 16:55 = 0.2758 hours

But I would not use it on a busy urban interstate where the other drivers are crazy and there are idiots doing all kinds of stupid things simultaneously (Phoenix-LA?). Also, I tried it at first on a narrow state highway (AZ 89A) where there is a section of switchbacks along a 500 foot cliff. The road there lacks standard lane lines in places, and twice my autopilot cut out when I was headed straight for a ditch. Also, sometimes it has trouble with highway sections that are not access restricted (like an interstate) and have left and right turns right off the road and the car ahead of you pulls left or right to turn.

@dgpcolorado, your original Poncha Springs visit was listed as 02/05/2018 (perhaps the date you posted to the thread?) but I updated it to Groundhog Day for ya. Good job being 2nd ever and perhaps 1st of the gang.

Only 13 people from the game have ever visited there and @evp was also there on Groundhog Day so both of you get credit as a ""first day visit."" Well done.

I'm surprised that it has had so few visits. For those of us who live in, or visit, SW Colorado, Poncha Springs was a huge improvement to the longer, more tedious I-70 route, as well as providing an alternate when rock slides close Glenwood Canyon. The route through Poncha Springs is also more scenic and more fun to drive than I-70.


Of the 15 people to visit Carlsbad, your previous date was listed as 09/23/2018 but is noted in red meaning it was more than 4 or 5 days before it opened. I'll update that to 09/27/2018 and it will be noted as a ""first"" so good job on another one and thanks for clarifying...

↑

I totally agree with you. Overall I have been very impressed with Optimum products. As we have been discussing here, I love the new Hyper Seal (like Opti Seal on steroids, due to the SiO2 content). The only Optimum product that is not my favorite is Opticlean, which is their waterless wash. It is a very good product, however I don't like the fact that since the solution is white in color it is hard for me to see the fill line when mixing the concentrate solution in my favorite spray bottle, which happens to be white also. In addition, I believe the dilution ratio is 4:1 so you don't get that many washes out of a single bottle. My new go to waterless wash is Mckee's 37 Waterless Wash On The Go. It is an orange color so it is super easy to see the fill line when adding water in the spray bottle. And the dilution ratio is 16:1, so it is more cost effective. I also personally like the scent a bit better than Opticlean as well.
""

I bought a 32oz bottle of Opticlean. I don't do waterless washes. I just use it as a quick detail spray at the wash dilution ratio. If I need to wash, I'll always use ONR as it's safer than Opticlean, and I can do an ONR wash using only half a gallon of water if I want to (Garry Dean microfiber towel method).",,0,0,0,0

This has got to be just a test setup for things like smoothing the tunnel floor and to get some publicity. It looks like they just used a macadam surface over the concrete.

Don't see what the point to all this is. There's no way a public tunnel is going to use Tesla cars on Autopilot for a very large set of reasons. I'm pretty doubtful that any vehicle relying on purely automatic steering will be allowed, for that matter. The point to the guide wheels was positive control. Driving on a macadam surface at 127 mph is hardly something that needs to be tested either.

↑

The other day my wife and I went to the store. We were on a rural road, wide and well marked. An oncoming car had slowed to a stop or nearly stopped. Then it turned left, crossed our path and entered a driveway. It was far enough away that had it stopped in the middle of my lane I would have had time to stop without using maximum braking force. I let it go without braking at all and I did this pretty much unconsciously. This is what I think my computer (brain) did in this situation:

* Oncoming vehicle detected in left lane ahead, stopped or nearly stopped. Unusual, so dedicate an additional 200,000 neurons to monitor this.
* Vehicle advanced into my lane and is headed straight for me. Path of vehicle is curved and projected path and speed will take it out of a collision threat if it continued. Watch closely.
* Computed time to collision if vehicle stops in my lane is 4.8 seconds. Maximum braking time for full stop to avoid collision is 3.2 seconds. Waited 1 second before applying brakes to see what vehicle does.
* Vehicle continued along its projected curved path, still partially in my lane but now the vehicle cannot stop in my lane due to its forward speed and its reasonable braking power.
* Continued driving without braking.

There was no collision or threat of collision and passenger remained calm. If I was using TACC it would have panicked at the first sign that the oncoming vehicle was in my lane (dumping that bag of groceries in the back seat and prompting a scream into my right ear), regardless if the vehicle was on a path that would take it out of a collision threat within time for my car to brake to a full stop. I'm not saying ""if I can do this why can't Tesla"", but I am puzzled as to why this seems to be so difficult. Tesla does so many other things that require some heavy computin' so why not this? It's got the required information to do so.

Just wondering.[/QUOTE]

Just wondering what.... Why we (as humans) can evaluate the above scenario better than a computer? Computers have a hard time telling the difference between things like an inflatable car and a real one, while we humans would not have such trouble. The reason computers are ""better"" drivers than humans is because we dont pay attention (at least not 100%). If all humans devoted 100% of their concentration to driving when they are driving, Its my belief that we would be better than any computer by a LOONG shot.

We dont, however, even when by ourselves, and even when NOT fiddling with phones, and music and such. We ""think about stuff"" when we drive... we listen to audio books, we talk to other humans... and thats all before we get to the people who eat things that require utensils while driving. 

True story.. just two days ago, while my wife and I were taking a trip from Temecula to San Marcos to look at smokers in a BBQ store, on the freeway, whie, traffic was going 80 miles an hour, we saw a man, in a minivan, with 2 kids in car seats in the back, ""driving"" with a fast food cup in his left hand, and a burger in his right hand. He basically had his wrists on the steering wheel, in an older minivan, driving 2 kids, at 80+ miles an hour.

THATS why computers are better drivers than us right now, because there is always someone on the road doing something like that. Personally, I believe you would WANT the car to err on the side of caution. Would you rather 100 times spilled groceries and noise, or 1 time when the car ""made a mistake"" and didnt take action when it should have?

Fact remains that Tesla will have serious competition and cash problems in the near future and I would not discount MB, BMW and VW's commitment to EVs as quickly as I would GM and Ford. You can believe AlixPartner or not but Tesla will not sell all these cars. - ""pure electric models will account for 20 percent of U.S. sales by 2030 while reaching 30 percent in Europe and 35 percent in China...""
IMO, if during that first time period, there is a jump to light speed in a technological improvement that lowers the price, the demand will be extraordinary for EVs.
""

Fact is that your ""facts"" are just made up speculation without any basis in actual fact.
None of the traditional automakers have been able to produce anything that comes close to the 2012 Model S. They are 5-10 years behind.
The only expertise they have is in making IC engines and transmissions. Everything else is farmed out. Unfortunately, ICE is obsolete and useless when making EVs so they have to start over. They have been reluctant to make the investment, hoping that EVs would just go away. They are now being forced to make EVs but their starting line is many years behind Tesla. I do hope they get their act together and start making some compelling EVs but I think it will take at least another five years. By then, Tesla will have moved forward another five years. 

Also, not sure why Tesla would have cash problems when they make a profit on every car they sell. If they were in the position of VW group, BMW, Mercedes, etc. where they lose money on their pathetically small production, it would be a problem.",,0,0,0,0

""

I think the Amazon shorts comparison is apt for the early days : Data Show Tesla Has More in Common With Amazon Than Enron

I was around for the infamous Barron's Amazon.bomb cover story - short interest was over 20% then. The consensus was low barrier to entry, competition would eat them alive, few people saw the ROIC and cash flow story playing out. At the time, the 1999 convertible debt of $1.8B was the biggest ever. And the info vacuum (even internally!), and churn of chewed-up smart people cycling over and over, was dismaying and very similar. Don't forget Henry Blodgett's $400 price target, an insane number, in 1998, the Cathie Wood of his time; he was widely mocked although he seems to have landed on his feet since then. 

The car market and brand are there for Tesla in much the same way that Amazon's customer obsession paid off, and the brand and battery manufacturing are very good moats. The only question in my mind is execution and cash flow, and I'm less sure that TSLA can execute as well as AMZN did in the 2000s, but the debt, short interest, and crazy Musk stories don't bother me, and I do think we should push back a bit on the disproportionate control that short sellers have over a company's health over the short term with ""news"" stories.",,0,0,0,0

for the audience, these curves are good for forecasting the behavior of the transition, but not the end point. That is an input.
So while downloading displaced, CDs displace tapes, which displaced LP, it wasn't 100% displacement before the next technology started to scale out.

we don't know that electric vehicle will go to 100%, that is our assumption. We particularly don't know that plug in electric vehicle will succeed over (say wireless electric vehicle)

I really don't think hydrogen electric vehicle will be viable anywhere that H2 is derived from methane, buts that is not global. In China hydrogen is cheaper than methane, perhaps in China H2 may become relevant (at a municipal bus level anyway)

looking forward, the solid oxide fuel cell that Nissan uses ethanol, methane, probably even kitchen scraps if someone fed it that.

to be blunt, I don't see the grid surviving 20years in Queensland Australia in its current form, I expect grid defection to occur at scale around 2028 in Qld (expiry feed in tariff). at that point at least one market will be primed for vehicle that runs on rum instead of electrons.
""

Just to be clear, I am not at all saying that the trajectory cannot be bent in some other direction, but that comes down to some sort of black swan type of emergent issue that is presently not in play in the recent history that the forecast is based upon. We can certainly imagine alternative scenarios. The leading one in my mind is that full autonomy comes much sooner than say 2025. We really have not seen in recent history how autonomy can change the automotive market, but it clearly would have the potential to radically revise the value of private ownership of autos. So autonomy is not in my model, but could radically bend the curve. Hydrogen, on they other hand, has been in play in the auto market for many years. It just does not compete well. So it is really hard to envision a scenario where hydrogen begins to catch up with EVs to surpass them by 2030. Of course, such competition would effectively kill of ICE even faster. So try to map out how fast HFCEVs would have to grow on an annual basis to catch up with EVs. So again, I'm not saying such disruptions cannot happen, but simply such disruptions have low probability and would be a radical departure from what we have seen to date. 

Another way to look at this is the this forecast is based on all plug-in vehicles. My strong suspicion is that successful hydrogen vehicles will actually be plug in hybrids, hydrogen FC+battery. Batteries will be a cheap way to give FCEVs acceleration power and regenerative braking. The FC is ideally suited as a range extender that functions mostly at an optimal output level. Nikola is doing this with their hydrogen trucks. So one may as well be able to charge the battery from the grid when convenient, and that option would also help mitigate limitations in hydrogen fueling station infrastructure. So there you go, you've got a fancy plug-in vehicle, and that falls into the bucket I'm modeling.",,0,0,0,0

The motor used for the 3 and Semi is a switched reluctance permanent magnet (SWRPM) motor. That presentation doesn't mention the LAGER unit being reluctance type, and from the diagrams it appears to use a novel rotor/coil/stator layout. I believe they are different motor types, although the 3/Semi motor may also use Halbach arrays (conjentured in the Munroe teardown).

As @mongo has pointed out, not being an induction motor means the 3/semi motor doesn't have the eddy currents in the rotor for the bearings to deal with. In the Model S, ceramic bearings are indeed used, as are shaft grounding brushes to bleed off the current to avoid arcing past the ceramic bearings.
""


The LAGER from 2007 doesn't have the special stuff from the 2015 presentation, just the Halbach arrays. Rest of the presentation is about the newer GTM design.

And the Model 3 rotor has the Halbach magnets. This is why I said it's like the LAGER motor which is a Halbach motor, but not switched reluctance. Model 3 rotor appears to have the mix of Halbach magnets and non-permanent magnetic poles.

If there's really someone get charged by 12%, can we complain to the Tesla HQ to lower the price a little bit ($80.01 to be exact) to push it down to $54999.99?
""

Not sure who to reach out to at The Mothership, but my ""pitch"" would be to lower the destination and doc fee in BC by $80.01 (so they don't have to show a lower vehicle price across the country). That also seems ""fair"" to other Canadians, given that our ""destination"" is closest to the factory. Not holding my breath though.

For Gerro, apparently the final contract on the website (I don't have it available yet, so can't confirm) is the one that was updated to show the 12%, but I assume that's where you're getting your numbers from?",,0,0,0,0

LIDAR would have prevented the accident, or at least allowed the car to know there was a stationary object in the way and tried to take evasive measures. You won't find reports of accidents like this with Wamo's fleet. But you also won't see LIDAR being used in a Tesla if it bumps up the price tag by $20,000 either.

That said, this accident is not the fault of autopilot. AP is just a driver assist. The driver needed to be watching and take over control soon as the stationary vehicle was seen. AP would allow the driver to look around and be more mindful of the vehicles around him than if he had to focus strictly on steering. If you're taking a nap, watching a movie, etc, then there is no one to blame but yourself if this happens.

I doubt Lidar would have helped here given the blocking vehicle prevents detection until the last second.

1. Got back to car, noticed dent. 

2. Went home, reviewed sentry footage. 7 events left a lot of footage to view, but it didn't take long to narrow it down to the offending vehicle. Watched footage of the offending vehicle pull in next to car. Watched mom get out of car, then the footage cuts out. When it resumes the entire family is behind their vehicle getting ready to walk away! It missed the ~20 seconds of video I needed where the rear door opened!

3. Start researching online, find that Tesla saves all video clips from last hour, etc. Immediately run an undelete app on the USB drive.

4. Recover ~400 video clips, 2 clips were corrupt. It was pretty obvious from scrolling through the previews that one of the 2 corrupt video files was the one with the footage I needed.

5. Tried 1,000 ways to view the file all worthless. Ready to give up, finally try 1,001 method to watch video and it works! Literally the video covers about 25 seconds of the missing footage. Pay $6 for video corruption fix.

3696242,Superchargers Visited,Only Trons,2019-05-27 13:28:00,"We wanted to go to Custer this year, but family commitments prevented us from making that trip. But we did the next best thing --- as part of our family commitment to attend a niece’s graduation event in Orlando, we made it a Tesla Road Trip. All the way down to Key West, and then back to Orlando. A lot of driving, but it was a lot of fun. And we added 36 superchargers to our total, so we have passed the 200 threshold: now we are at 218. (Watch out @Bighorn  ha ha) And looks like we just missed seeing @PLUS EV 

For our overnight stops, we planned to stay at locations that had destination chargers. And we made certain to let the staff know that we stayed there specifically for that reason. While we were at Key West, I had the opportunity to do a lot of photography. 

For the most part, the superchargers we visited were no more than half full. The (few) issues we had were:

1. Santee, SC. We started at about 65 KW, which was much lower than expected. Our SOC was about 10% upon arrival. We were initially the only ones there. We were having lunch at Clark’s Restaurant, when we noted that our charge rate decreased to about 35 KW. I walked outside to find that another X had started charging in the stall that was paired with us. I went over and spoke with them – they were new owners and very polite. But they didn’t know about sharing of power between pedestals. I explained it to them (as well as a few other things), so they moved to a different pedestal. My charge level recovered to only about 45 KW. Since we were staying for lunch it was not a problem, but I think this location has problems. As we were wrapping up there, we had the opportunity to chat with several other owners who had arrived. I think we were able to help them gain knowledge about Tesla, supercharging, etc. We have been owners since early 2013, when superchargers were scarce and meeting someone else at a supercharger was an event! 

2. Fort Drum, FL. The problem here is that there are only 6 pedestals. We arrived to find all stalls occupied. We had to wait about 15 or 20 minutes, when two owners departed. 

3. Turkey Lake, FL. Same problem as at Fort Drum: only 6 pedestals, and all were occupied. Only had to wait about 10 minutes here.

4. W. Sand Lake Rd, FL. 8 stalls, all occupied when we arrived. One stall provided no power. And then a second one went down. A lady in a Model 3 was at one of the stalls – she said she worked for Tesla, and would report the inoperative pedestals. 

5. Florence, SC. I’ve been at this SC before and have seen the same problems. 18 stalls, of which about half are marked for 30 minute general parking. Time and time again I have seen ICE vehicles in all the general parking slots. One previous time I visited there was a broken ICE in one of the slots, and the two adjacent slots were taken by people helping the broken down ICE. Hood was up, and it was apparent that they were going to be there for awhile. On this trip, I watched as people drove into the parking lot and looked for close parking spots, and these fit the bill. While there are 18 stalls, this results in about half of them being unavailable for those NEEDING a charge. 

6. Rocky Mount: We received the ""high usage supercharger site"" alert that others have reported. Never seen this before. There was NO ONE else at the supercharger while we were there.

@Story - I think I may not completely understand what you're saying. TOU and NEM are separate things. You can have NEM with a TOU rate plan (in fact, it's required under NEM 2.0). If you're switching from a non-TOU to a TOU rate plan, it should not affect your NEM agreement.

The letter says the maximum netting that is allowed each billing period is the theoretical output of your solar system, which I believe is based on the nameplate rating and a model of the weather/sun exposure. This is to prevent you from exporting all your solar and then also charging your Powerwall from the grid during off-peak and discharging it during peak rate periods (which is actually impossible to do with current configurations any way).

Yep, ONR is a great way to wash your car. I will do a rinseless ONR wash if the car is on the dirtier side. Of course, if it is super dirty, I'll do a traditional wash with a foam gun. But where I live we need to keep the water use to a minimum. For me, as long as the car is not too dirty, I like the speed of a waterless wash.

Not sure who to reach out to at The Mothership, but my ""pitch"" would be to lower the destination and doc fee in BC by $80.01 (so they don't have to show a lower vehicle price across the country). That also seems ""fair"" to other Canadians, given that our ""destination"" is closest to the factory. Not holding my breath though.

For Gerro, apparently the final contract on the website (I don't have it available yet, so can't confirm) is the one that was updated to show the 12%, but I assume that's where you're getting your numbers from?

I normally enter and leave Yosemite via Hwy 120 and use the Groveland supercharger, charging to the max since charging in Yosemite is scarce. Yesterday our cabin lost power and a surprise snow storm hit (yes over Memorial Day weekend) and due to the hazardous conditions and a couple of big accidents BOTH Hwy 120 and Hwy 41 were closed. Those are the only was out of Yosemite that have superchargers along the route. I went to the Majestic Hotel but both chargers were in use and the Model 3 on the J1772 said it would be full in 25 HOURS.

So I had to exit using Hwy 140 through Mariposa and went very close to this proposed location. Even though I needed to go northwest back to the Bay Area, I didn't have enough range to reach Manteca, and only 4% remaining if I tried to make Gustine. The slightly safer bet was to go to the totally wrong direction down to FRESNO and arrive with a forecast 7%. So I drove 40-45 MPH the whole way and made it to Fresno.

Since Hwy 140 is the only year round accessible route into and out of Yosemite, I'd say it's essential that it have a Supercharger along the route, and Mariposa would be the perfect place. Hope Tesla can get past whatever is delaying it and get it built before winter hits again.",,0,0,0,0

I believe in the ARK valuation...$tsla will be $700-$4000 in 5 years. Tsla is like 6 companies in 1.

1. (Battery Business) Making own batteries...they now have multiple gig-factories. And to quote the CEO of VW...each car manufacturer will deliver up to the number of batteries they can get. Only tesla is making their own and with Maxwell they are way ahead. With vertical alignment in the supply chain, Tesla could potentially sell batteries to others at a huge premium. Tesla 50KwH battery would be equivalent to LG Chem 70Kwh in terms of range.

2. Autonomy business, baring the bad news. But remember once VW and others have some sort of self driving, and their drivers crash how bad will the tesla news be? Tesla is competing with Mobileye and nvdia in this space. They could potentially sell their own self drive to others

3. Software business, this is a given. They are doing well here

4. Robo-taxis - competing and beating uber and lyft... cost per mile $.18 vs $2.00 respectively. There are a lot of hard problems with picking people up. They could have drop zones, where the human walks to the exact spot on every street. the last mile of this problem is potentially challenging, but if anyone is able to have a robo taxi fleet it will be Tesla.

5. Insurance Business - Buffet and Munger are in the cross hairs of Elon, you can feel he wants to disrupt their archaic business. He is armed with user driving data, which is a gold mine. No other insurance carrier has this unless they install a special device and that too is not at parity with what Tesla has.

6. Tesla Brand -  Huge value just in the Brand. They just need to deliver on what they promise.

7. Other business -  I am not a believer in rooftop solar, I think the local carriers have a competitive advantage of tesla in this space. This is a cut throat business, and the barrier to entry is a roofer + electrician with a little bit of capital $100k ish. Tesla needs to get out of this. When we went solar, Tesla could not compete against the local guys in price and service.

""

Impossible to do with the X in the video unless you have an identical car....but....

I really think measuring the Wh/rmi with a long trip will help determine whether or not this Supercharger screen “matches” the trip meter, etc. 

I understand the original purpose was to “estimate battery capacity”, but in the end all we can determine is the number of “kWh” which represents a full charge. This may or may not align with the actual full battery capacity for aforementioned reasons. I put kWh in quotes because the readout on the trip meter is somewhat arbitrary and might not represent true kWh.

I do think that since Tesla is charging by the kWh, there is some reason to think that the kWh they charge you for there represent true kWh. 

@Zoomit answered this before (can’t remember the answer), but there are a couple relevant questions:

1) Which kWh does Tesla charge for? Only the ones delivered to the pack in the form of rated miles, or the ones from the DC side of the Supercharger (by necessity these will be different by a bit).

2) As asked above, if you calculate kWh delivered by Supercharger and compare to rated miles added, does that Wh/rmi constant align with that calculated from observing the trip meter?

3) If these Wh/rmi values are consistent, what do they imply about the capacity of the battery pack? If they are not consistent, does it simply mean Tesla is charging for kWh from the DC charger, or does it mean the trip meter doesn’t capture everything, or what? To some extent it is hard to answer these questions without knowing how the various Wh/rmi constants differ.

The only piece of data I have is that in a P3D the trip meter Wh/rmi appears to be 230-235Wh/rmi...have not tried any measurements at a Supercharger.",,0,0,0,0

Had the chance to connect to my 2017 Mar build V3 pack S90D’s CANBUS. It has been exactly 2 years since it was in traffic and my remaining full pack is 80,2kWh. 2 weeks ago it was 80,6kWh. This equates to around 423-430km on 100%.

Car is at 60,000km (37,2k mi)

When I bought it exactly 6 months ago @41k km(25.5k mi) it was showing 438km and 83.2kWh. So an additional 3,5% loss in 6 months is eery. I’ve charged to 100% maybe 4-5 times.

Previous owner who bought it new was charging to 100% daily but he said he was charging at a slow current setting. He made 25,5k mi in a year and a 90D brand new should be like 85kwh @447-450km when full. So even though he was abusing the pack by often fully charging it he lost 3% in a year but I lost 3,5% more in the past 6 months? Isn’t this odd?

When you factor in the 4kWh buffer I have 76,2kwh usable and realistically I could at best maybe use 75kwh on a roadtrip. After 2 years I’m left with a 400V 75D then...

Update. Had a 1000 mile roadtrip last weekend. Made a total of 4 ChaDeMo DC charges (No superchargers in my zone and car was never Supercharged)

The car really doesn't know what the ""main"" road is, or should be. 
And yes, Y-intersections are the kryptonite for Tesla's AP. At all speeds, and under all circumstances.

Two ways for you to potentially mitigate your situation:
1). Drive under Navigate on AP, which would manifest a preference to bear left or right at that intersection.
2). Drive in the right-most lane, to remove the turn decision from AP's consideration.
3). Drive behind another car, if available. AP will follow and do whatever the leading car is doing.

FYI, investigating such matters is what I do. I have investigated more than 2 dozen Toyota SUA cases, as well as multiple various others, including two Tesla's. I know of at least two dozen specific different causes for SUA that has been proven, including software/firmware faults. And, these are exacerbated when the vehicle is not also equipped with a Brake Override Feature (Brake signal gets priority over Accelerator Pedal signal). And, for internal combustion engine vehicles, the idea you can stop the car with the brake is a myth. Yes, you can do it if you catch it immediately and only press the brake ONCE. When the throttle is wide open, you have a 100% vacuum leak to the atmosphere and power brake assist only works on the first try. After that, you dramatically lose brake force and once moving rapidly, it becomes increasing difficult to impossible to significantly reduce vehicle speed. There are numerous YouTube videos demonstrating this. Brake Override substantially fixes this.

Was always watching people their projects of converting cars or other vehicles from gas to electric. After a lot of reading and researching I started my own project just to see if it was possible for me to do it and also if it would be possible to get it road legal in my country (The Netherlands). Since I wanted to start small I decided to go with a quad bike but not an ordinary 4x4 all terain, instead I bought one that was meant for street/road use only and started stripping it from the ICE components right away. This project took me around 3,5 years with many ups and downs but in the end I managed to complete the build and get it road legal after having it tested at the RDW. A few quick pictures to show what it looks like.  I also have a blog where I documented the whole project, just not sure if I'm allowed to post the link to it. You can find it in my profile if you're interested.

 

 

 

I had so much fun building it, and riding it as well ofcourse, that I was really sure my next car had to be electric as well. I just wasn't sure if I'd convert a gas powered car or if I would just buy an electric car. There just wasn't much choice at that point with the Model S and Model X being way too expensive and the other options being not so great (Nissan Leaf / Renault Zoe). But I already heard that a new and affordable Tesla would be announced at some point so I wanted to wait for that to be able to make a decision. When it finally got announced I just knew right away that the Tesla Model 3 would be my next car and made the deposit to be on the reservation list. I had already started saving some money but knew I needed a lot more so the last few years I've really been saving hard to get that 35k euro together and thankfully succeeded with that as well. Ofcourse, that 35k euro Model 3 is pretty much a myth now but with the Standard Range Plus being at around 50k euro I think it's still a very good buy. If you look at the gas powered competition from BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen and Audi I just see no reason to buy anything else but a Tesla.  I won't even mention other EV's since they're not even close to Tesla in my opinion. Only downside is that I have to take a small loan now but I think it'll be very worth it.

 

So that's how I decided to buy a Tesla. I actually ordered/configured the Model 3 Standard Range Plus almost 3 weeks ago. It's going to be blue with black interior and aero wheels. Also added the tow hitch since it'll be very useful to tow my quad bike on a trailer sometimes, the range isn't that great yet so it's the only way I can really go and ride it at different locations untill I upgrade the battery pack.
Tesla already called me and confirmed that it will probably get delivered in June. I've never been more excited for anything, it's been such a long wait and now it's finally happening in a few weeks time. I'm really happy to join the Tesla family soon and the TMC community right here.",,0,0,0,0

↑

I exclusively use Optimum's products, because everything I've used so far as just worked well and it's not terribly expensive... hard to disagree with that!

I love doing ONR washes. Opti-seal is best applied on a dry, clean surface, but it is possible to wash, clay + wax, and seal in sequence (theragcompany has a video on it). Add a 2nd coat 12+ hours later, but no sooner. Finish with Optimum Car Wax (easy to apply spray wax) and you are good to go. I have their clay towel and it's also excellent. I would not apply Opti-seal every wash, because it's a sealant and it should last several months unless you use something that strips the sealant off - some car wash soaps (particularly the stuff at any business wash place), Optimum Power Clean, are some examples of things that will deteriorate the sealant. If doing proper maintenance washing with ONR, Opti-seal can last 6+ months according to Yvan Lacroix (OPT's training director). Still, every 3-4 months I'd probably strip the paint with Power Clean and start fresh since the products are easy to apply and cheap to do so.
""

I use Opti seal ( or hyper seal) every wash, and never strip it down. I’ve done this on multiple cars for at least 2-3 years without any issue at all. I use it as a drying aid.

Thank you, I was wondering if all the windows blocked UV in some way (metallized glass or something). 

UV lights are used to ""cure"" (as in harden) certain types of glue used in displays and other applications. But I have yet to find any scholarly or engineering articles that show UV light remediating yellowing in a display. So I have my doubts about UV used as anything but a temporary fix (if that). The glue dries chemically. To return it to its original liquid state would seem to require a chemical reaction that would likely be destructive to the display.

Were I in Tesla's engineering department I would say keep it simple (KISS) and replace the display.

It sounds like that feature may be coming now with this new PG&E restrictions. I'd like to sell back all solar from my 3.2kw system, and charge my three Powerwalls nightly during non-peak (I'm on the EV-A tariff). I hope that is coming, otherwise why limit what we can sell back?
""

I hope so too, but I suspect it is unrelated. My interconnect agreement had the Powerwalls classified as ""non-NEM eligible storage."" I think this means that my Powerwalls are never supposed to export to the grid. Since there's only one meter and there would be no way to distinguish whether it's solar export or battery export they use the estimated production instead since if the export exceeds solar production, it clearly must have come from the battery. It seems like time-shifting solar production would be allowed by this enforcement mechanism, though. With the new EV-A schedule, you could charge from solar until 3pm and then export all that energy from 4pm-9pm at peak rates.",,0,0,0,0

New to Tesla this year, S85, thrilled with the car, 7k miles in 4 months, now 58k. Plan to keep the car for ?10 years.
Prior owner had NO service done on car, sold it when the 4 year warranty expired.
No problems with car so far.

However, I had feelings of doom and despair this week when came across threads discussing the replacement of eMMC in the MCU1.
This sounds like a HUGE problem - but this was not mentioned in this (or most) threads discussing experience with high-mileage Model S, including resale.
Some posters have stated the Tesla service rep advised them to expect about 50k miles from the MCU!

Do those of you with out of warranty >50k mileage just plan to spend ~$3k every 50 k miles or so to replace the MCU?? Or hope Tesla comes up with a firmware fix (such as reducing dramatically the utilization of the eMMC)?
Is this in actuality a rare problem and not a big deal?
A little concerned about being far from home in adverse weather with family when the MCU does go out - and the expense...
At least one poster also stated there were issues with availability of replacement units and Tesla's willingness to replace them even for $3k.
Look forward to others' input, thanks in advance.

My wife (driver for over 40 years, no accidents, no tickets) was stopped at a traffic light on a downgrade, foot on the brake, in our brand new Tesla Model 3 when it suddenly began to move forward and crashed into cars stopped at the light in front of her. My wife tried desperately to stop the Tesla with the brakes and emergency brake. She was helpless as the car was uncontrollable and would not respond to her actions. The party that was hit called the police who showed up in force because the Tesla was essentially using her car as a brake as her car moved forward. The police were very rough with my wife as if she had done something criminal, adding to her trauma. The other party reported injuries and we and our insurance are on the hook for a crash that was not our fault. I hate to think of what could have happened had there not been cars there to stop my wife in the Tesla. We purchased the Tesla in December of 2018 and the crash occurred in February of 2019. After the crash I called Tesla, then I went to their showroom in San Diego. They brushed me off and referred me to Teslalegal.com. So I asked my attorney to help. In the meantime, after the Tesla was released from the body shop it was sent to the Tesla Service Center in San Diego. Immediately, my attorney emailed [email protected] for Tesla to preserve and provide the Electronic Driving Record to determine what happened to the car. After two weeks she received an email reply advising us to contact the local Service Center for that information. My attorney then tried to contact the Service Center rep via a text number given to me but was ignored. When I told the Tesla rep my attorney was trying to contact them I was told they couldn’t talk to her and that the Tesla Legal Team would be in contact. At this point Tesla definitely knows that we have a problem. Our attempts at contact began immediately after the crash in February. As of May 15th there is no contact yet. With the knowledge that I had an attorney, Tesla service still sent me documents to sign. They recently sent me a text that they have “updated firmware with the latest version” and the car “is safe to drive at this time.” To me it sounds like they modified the Tesla. My attorney has called and emailed Tesla Service, Tesla Customer Service, Tesla Legal, and Tesla Headquarters in Fremont. She has written letters and sent them by email to all of the above and mailed them certified mail. In the letters she has explained that my wife and I are fearful of driving the car and definitely don’t want anyone else to get hurt. She has asked that they contact her to discuss the matter. There is no response from Tesla. We struggled to buy this car. We are seniors and wanted a nice, safe, dependable car. We are afraid to drive the car for fear that someone could be seriously hurt or even killed. The Tesla sits in the Service Center storage. Now we have no car and Tesla has our substantial money. Tesla obviously doesn’t care.

AP does not just use a neural net for image identification (e.g. where the lines are). Tesla has taken the approach of a neural network for the driving decisions as well. This system has minimal, if any future prediction (in current implementation). So it's purely looking at ""am I in the middle of a lane"" because that's how it's been trained (for default AP, NoA is trained to take exits). It does not look ahead to see ""where am I going to be in that splitting lane"" (yet). 

Because it's a NN, you can't just introduce behaviors arbitrarily like with fixed code ""do this when the lane splits"". You would have to train the system on what to do with wider lanes. But wider lane behavior is not consistent, nor does Tesla have a frame rate that supports specialized decision making at high speed when lane markers change. 

Hopefully these things will be fixed with HW3 training + FPS upgrades, but until then this is not a surprising behavior given how autopilot is created.",,0,0,0,0

3696352,Model 3 Performance vs Model S 75D,WilliamG,2019-05-27 14:07:00,"So, as some of you may or may not know, my new Model 3P was taken out of action by a mysterious object that made a hole right through the wheel and tire in the first week.

For reasons unbeknownst to me, the Tesla Service Center did not get a replacement tire in for over a week, so... during that time I was given a 2018 Model S 75D to drive.

So here's my review of the 2018 Model S 75D, and how it compares to my 2019 Model 3P.

1.) So, firstly, the Model S is significantly longer than the Model 3. My garage only accommodates a 192"" car MAX, so the Model S doesn't fit.

2.) The Model S is a boat by comparison. Everything about it feels... large. 

3.) The panoramic sunroof is more enveloping in the S because it runs the roofline without the dome lights in the middle like in the 3. The S just feels more open to me. 

4.) Air suspension on the S is fabulous. I know there's new suspension (Raven) on the just-released revision, but boy is the air suspension on the S really nice to have. My Performance Model 3 suspension isn't terrible or anything, but there are times when I wish I could just soften everything up and cruise along crappy roads.

5.) Power. No comparison. The Model 3 Performance destroys the 75D, as you'd expect. Interestingly, the 75D gets off the line pretty darn quickly, but at 40mph upwards it feels like a dog. 60mph when you put your foot down it's almost as if nothing happens (slight exaggeration). Whether a combination of weight or de-tuning of the motors, the 75D is great down low, and puny up top.

6.) Motor whine. The 75D I had featured some pretty ugly motor whine, especially at 49-51mph when not accelerating. It manifests itself as a really high-pitched squealing-like sound, and it drove me a bit nuts. My P3D does not have any such noises.

7.) The interior. I have to say, while the S has some fanciers things going on (heated steering wheel, air suspension etc) - the interior in my opinion is a giant mess by comparison to the 3. The doors look like they were designed by three or four people at the same time in different rooms - with no communication between them until the last second. The interior door handles are in the absolute worst place, where there's little leverage to push the door open, and the button locations and lack of storage cubbies in the doors is insanity to me. Where the door material meats the dash material it doesn't match at all - and in all honesty I think that whole area of the car is a travesty. 

As an aside, the piece of the door you're supposed to pull to close the door had a lot of movement to it on my driver's side, which just screamed cheap to me. 

8.) The dual screens. I know this will be subjective, but honestly I really, really do not like the S screen orientation or design. It looks like a screen shoehorned into a dash. I felt this way when I test-drove the P85D many years ago when it was new, and I still feel the same now. It feels outdated, a bit of a cluttered mess due to the narrow vertical orientation, and some icons being in the corners are just awkward to hit. In addition, I'm 6'5"" and with my seat back enough - it's hard for me to reach the top of the screen as it leans back there. I prefer the 3 here greatly. Also, I really prefer not having the dash right in front of me, so I can be focusing on the road. I know this will be subjective. 

9.) Handling. There's no question the P3D is a much better handling car. You feel more from the road (pros and cons to this) AND the steering wheel. There's almost no steering wheel feel from the 75D whereas I can actually feel things through the wheel with the P3D steering wheel. I haven't driven a base 3 so I can't comment there, but with the P3D everything is far more connected than with the 75D. 

10.) Rattles: While the 3 is not free of rattles, my Model S wasn't either. Some really annoying ones from the rear hatch that drove me nuts just about the entire time I had the car. 

11.) Trunk. I love the automatic trunk on the S. Ironically, for my uses, I'm glad I don't have one. Since my car is so tight in my garage, if I popped it by mistake I'd destroy the trunk, but... when out and about it was super useful. 

12.) Exterior door handles: You know, I'm not sure which I prefer here. I think the S handles are pretty cool (aside from looking like toilet-roll holders), but I actually really dig the Model 3 handles, too. I especially love the way you open the Model 3 doors from the inside. It blows away the Model S in this regard.

13.) Usability: I love the phone holder in the front of the 3, and with the Nomad wireless charger it's fabulous. The slide-out cubby in the Model S is... awkward and not fun to open at all.

14.) Arm rests. I could not STAND the arm rests in the Model S. They slide to uncover the cup holder, which means either you have a cup holder or you have an arm rest. Annoyingly, my arm kept sliding the arm rest back under normal use, which I got tired of pretty darn fast.

15.) I really like the Model 3 turn signals. There's no ""detent"" where the stalk moves into for permanent signaling, so when you have completed your turn the stalk doesn't move again - it just disables the signal electronically. I love that. No ""click/smack"" sound.

16.) Panel gaps and fit and finish: Both cars have their issues. Both cars have crappy paint (both are solid black, so I was able to compare), and not all pieces of chrome trim etc were 100%. Alignment on doors etc isn't 100% either. Just the usual Tesla nonsense. None of it is deal-breaking, but it's there.

I'm sure I'm missing some things, but that's it for now. 

Overall, it's not a contest. The 3 is the better car for most people. The S feels extremely outdated, and really needs an interior refresh.

Universal Mobile Connector should be included in your car and the minimum adapter that it should include is for 120V charging.

Technically, you don't need home charging if you have the discipline to Supercharge.

Still, there are some considerations:

1) Home is more convenient and cheap as stated by others above.

2) Elon Musk complained about Supercharging by the locals in 2015. Legally, when you bought a buffet meal, it's all you can eat but since the complaint of 2015, there have been an ""us"" and ""them"" mentality to strike a friendly conversion and spy on whether you are a local or not!

3) Tesla does throttle your Supercharger rate down if you have reached an unknown numbers of fast DC charging (including CHAdeMO, CCS, Supercharger...)

4) There have been studies published on whether Supercharging is bad for your battery longevity. If it is good then why Tesla throttle your Supercharger rate?",,0,0,0,0

What I've noticed on car forums over time is its gone from not liking Tesla because they are pure EV to wanting other EV's to succeed to assist in the demise of Tesla!
I think part of the hate is not always because people don't like EV's its some of the Tesla fanboys that have turned people off the brand. In many ways Telsa are very much the Apple of the automotive world. People who are 100% exclusively locked in to the Apple ecosystem (regardless if there is better options) can be quite annoying, close minded and are definitely apologists for bad decisions and sometimes sub par products...lets be honest we see some of that behaviour on here.
I think my Model-S is a brilliant car and of all the vehicles I own I look forward to driving it the most (mainly because of the performance). But it has its fair share of issues that I grizzle about and unfortunately I would say are also never going to be resolved with the way the company is run.

This is not the first time there has been a rocky rollout of a new Tesla feature.

Thank you much for this one, @Navin!

Jobs makes a very important point about the perceptual time lag of the press. They are still looking where Tesla was.

It's interesting to consider that the slower a company is moving the smaller the difference in perception between where a company was, is, and will be. However, most will not factor this into their assessments based on press reportage.

MAAR voordat ik ging bellen maar ff kijken op de RDW Open data-site of ik al iets kon zien en tot mijn grote verbazing stond daar €54,4k (heb witte lak, dus zou €54,6k moeten zijn maar ok). Blijkbaar weten ze bij Tesla niet meer van elkaar waarmee de ander bezig is. Tenminste zo komt het bij mij over na vele telefoontjes waarin de laatste keren heel helder bevestigd werd dat men er niets meer aan kon doen en dat de cataloguswaarde €57,8k (€53 + 1,6 witte lak + 3,2 AP) zou worden. I.i.g. opgelucht dat er administratief na 8 (!) facturen wel iéts goed lijkt te gaan.

En toen hét grote moment; vanmiddag zou ik de Tesla waarnaar ik bijna 3 jaar heb uitgekeken in Tilburg gaan ophalen, de spreekwoordelijke slingers hingen al op thuis.

I left my car at the Tesla shop this morning for the 60.000 Km checking. Will recover it tomorrow morning.

Upgrading it for me would only mean to have the ""fake"" Sentry Mode and a zooming sprite in my IC. I do not need the former (basically only park in closed areas) and don't care for the latter.
At the same time I would gain a less effective AutoPilot (no short radius bends), a crippled ALC (5 secs timeout and no change with stalk engaged), a reduced range Summon.
The browser will remain the same (barely usable, thanks to the ""no traffic data"" trick), the USB music player will remain the same (just the bare minimum to use make it usable), no TeslaCam, no NoA.

My wife (driver for over 40 years, no accidents, no tickets) was stopped at a traffic light on a downgrade, foot on the brake, in our brand new Tesla Model 3 when it suddenly began to move forward and crashed into cars stopped at the light in front of her. My wife tried desperately to stop the Tesla with the brakes and emergency brake. She was helpless as the car was uncontrollable and would not respond to her actions. The party that was hit called the police who showed up in force because the Tesla was essentially using her car as a brake as her car moved forward. The police were very rough with my wife as if she had done something criminal, adding to her trauma.

Are you SURE she was pressing the brake, and not the accelerator pedal?
I know she is your wife, and you have to take her side of the story in private, but how SURE are you? 
100%? Why?

Do you have any data that would support her claim?
BTW, how exactly did she say she tried to apply the ""parking brake""?

I've never owned any car, including Tesla, that could not over-ride accelerator input by pressing the brakes.
If you press the brake pedal hard enough, it the calipers will press the pads onto the rotor hard enough to lock the wheels from moving. Regardless of what the motor is trying to do.

Tesla has no competition at all currently so they have no incentive to do anything about such issues, so what ever happens, happens.

I hope so too, but I suspect it is unrelated. My interconnect agreement had the Powerwalls classified as ""non-NEM eligible storage."" I think this means that my Powerwalls are never supposed to export to the grid. Since there's only one meter and there would be no way to distinguish whether it's solar export or battery export they use the estimated production instead since if the export exceeds solar production, it clearly must have come from the battery. It seems like time-shifting solar production would be allowed by this enforcement mechanism, though. With the new EV-A schedule, you could charge from solar until 3pm and then export all that energy from 4pm-9pm at peak rates.

I'm currently on EV-A, and I've setup my Powerwalls to Cost Savings, so my PV charges my Powerwall during partial peak, and then sells back all peak power to PG&E while it runs my house from the Powerwall...

Non-Peak & Partial Peak - Runs the house from the grid. If there is PV generated power, then charge my Powerwall

Blijkbaar weten ze bij Tesla niet meer van elkaar waarmee de ander bezig is. Tenminste zo komt het bij mij over na vele telefoontjes waarin de laatste keren heel helder bevestigd werd dat men er niets meer aan kon doen en dat de cataloguswaarde €57,8k (€53 + 1,6 witte lak + 3,2 AP) zou worden. I.i.g. opgelucht dat er administratief na 8 (!) facturen wel iéts goed lijkt te gaan.

En toen hét grote moment; vanmiddag zou ik de Tesla waarnaar ik bijna 3 jaar heb uitgekeken in Tilburg gaan ophalen, de spreekwoordelijke slingers hingen al op thuis. Maar helaas, bij aankomst een vriendelijke jongeman die ons verzoekt plaats te nemen in wachtruimte en paar minuten later komt vertellen dat hij slecht nieuws heeft: de auto is niet klaar, iets met lakschade. FYI: de auto stond hier al 2 weken en zou hem eigenlijk afgelopen vrijdag al hebben opgehaald. Waarom dat niet even eerder checken??

Onverrichterzake naar huis gereden met een leen-Tesla-S. 99% zekerheid dat ik hem morgenmiddag alsnog kan ophalen, dat hoor ik morgenochtend. Hele planning en allerlei afspraken weer moeten omgooien.

And for that matter, charging itself doesn't have to be a delay on a trip. Just a little bit of planning can easily allow a 500 mile trip require 0 time for charging. As long as you schedule the meal at a Supercharger, and maybe a few stretch breaks, it is pretty easy to go the distance as fast as an ICE would take you. 
I just took 4 500 mile trips in the last 2 weeks and the total amount allocated to specifically charging was probably an hour. And that was only because we didn't have much flexibility due to schedule. If I could have left an hour or two earlier, it would have been close to 0.

As with EV ownership, this is all about range anxiety. I've been driving a 88 mile Leaf for over 3 years and now a LR RWD 3 for a year. Before I leave on a long trip, I just check what my options are, but that's about it. I use the car's Nav, but I often deviate from it's suggestions.

↑

Impossible to do with the X in the video unless you have an identical car....but....

I really think measuring the Wh/rmi with a long trip will help determine whether or not this Supercharger screen “matches” the trip meter, etc.

I understand the original purpose was to “estimate battery capacity”, but in the end all we can determine is the number of “kWh” which represents a full charge. This may or may not align with the actual full battery capacity for aforementioned reasons. I put kWh in quotes because the readout on the trip meter is somewhat arbitrary and might not represent true kWh.

I do think that since Tesla is charging by the kWh, there is some reason to think that the kWh they charge you for there represent true kWh.

@Zoomit answered this before (can’t remember the answer), but there are a couple relevant questions:

1) Which kWh does Tesla charge for? Only the ones delivered to the pack in the form of rated miles, or the ones from the DC side of the Supercharger (by necessity due to I^2*R and other battery charging losses these will be different by a bit)?

2) As asked above, if you calculate kWh delivered by Supercharger and compare to rated miles added, does that Wh/rmi constant align with that calculated from observing the trip meter?

3) If these Wh/rmi values are consistent, what do they imply about the capacity of the battery pack? If they are not consistent, does it simply mean Tesla is charging for kWh from the DC charger, or does it mean the trip meter doesn’t capture everything, or what? To some extent it is hard to answer these questions without knowing how the various Wh/rmi constants differ, and how the implications of the calculated constants on the total battery capacity compare to the battery capacity declared in the EPA tests (again the EPA number is for a full discharge and it is likely that a full rated miles discharge will not discharge the entire EPA quantity due to the below 0 buffer, and perhaps for other reasons).

The only piece of data I have is that in a P3D the trip meter Wh/rmi appears to be 230-235Wh/rmi...have not tried any measurements at a Supercharger.
""

Those, right there, are a hard set of questions to answer! I feel we're chipping away at them but definitely requires more data and some critical thinking.

Here's my post that I think you referred to. Exactly how many miles driven per hour of charge?

It basically says that the charging screen power indication is power to the battery, not the whole car. I would expect that Tesla charges based on the power output of the Supercharger, not just the power going into the battery. That's just my speculation that they'd want to bill for the all the power provided, including charging losses and accessory usage.",,0,0,0,0

I don't think a pure Halbach array can be switched reluctance. The only way that's possible if there is a mechanism to move them. So this always works as a PM motor. And if Tesla calls it switched reluctance, then they might have combined these two systems.
""

I believe a later teardown showed they are not actually halbach arrays. My thought is that the magnets direct the flux from an inner set of stator poles and the outer set of poles act as a typical reluctance motor. That allows twice as many poles, reducing the torque ripple. 
To see what I mean, compare the number of stator slots (54) to the number of rotor sections (6). Each pair of rotor sections form a pole pair, giving 3. This is a three phase motor, so requires 6 slots for a full set of stator pole pairs. That gives us 54/3/6=3 sets of stator poles per rotor pole pair. Thus, there is a set of poles formed between the stator poles which align with the rotor shape. Here, the uppercase are the stator poles that align to the rotor reluctance sections, and the lower case are the stator poles that align to the permanent magnet section. The periods correspond to the undriven phase. 
NN.ss.nn.SS.nn.ss. repeat 3 times
Net result: large rotor flux sections and small stator phase angle, giving high power and low ripple. Without the magnets, the adjacent stator poles would be 'shorted' through the rotor.",,1,0,0,0

I believe a later teardown showed they are not actually halbach arrays. My thought is that the magnets direct the flux from an inner set of stator poles and the outer set of poles act as a typical reluctance motor. That allows twice as many poles, reducing the torque ripple.
To see what I mean, compare the number of stator slots (54) to the number of rotor sections (6). Each pair of rotor sections form a pole pair, giving 3. This is a three phase motor, so requires 6 slots for a full set of stator pole pairs. That gives us 54/3/6=3 sets of stator poles per rotor pole pair. Thus, there is a set of poles formed between the stator poles which align with the rotor shape. Here, the uppercase are the stator poles that align to the rotor reluctance sections, and the lower case are the stator poles that align to the permanent magnet section. The periods correspond to the undriven phase.
NN.ss.nn.SS.nn.ss. repeat 3 times
Net result: large rotor flux sections and small stator phase angle, giving high power and low ripple. Without the magnets, the adjacent stator poles would be 'shorted' through the rotor.

""

yes but it is their SuperCharger network, not yours.

even if we agree that they owe you an unlimited amount of supercharger usage -- which I personally don't, as I see a ""fair use"" issue already coming into play.. but lets assume unlimited supercharging is really the order of the day...

lets say you are entitled to as much free supercharging as you can possibly handle... you are a true road warrior who will spend the rest of his life driving 240 miles back and froth from theoretical supercharger A to supercharger B, non stop.. ad infinitum until the wheels on your Tesla fall off... Tesla promised you this.. they must deliver.. or the knives come out.. not to mention the lawyers. (personally I think this is a very weak argument.. but these are interesting times... who knows how this argument might hold up in court)

you OWN the car.. how you charge it your your business.. ok... i'll play along.

here's the thing you are forgetting: 

Tesla never once said they are giving up ownership of WHEN you can supercharge.

so even if they promised you that you can gorge yourself on supercharging electrons to your hearts content... charging to 265 miles on your S85D -- after all you need a buffer for your 240 mile commute drive between SuperChargers A and B.. it's not unreasonable... 

but Tesla can tell you WHEN to charge. and in this way, when they need to, and for the good of the entire Tesla community, they are now saying.. ""sorry.. it takes to long to give you those extra 25 miles at the top end of your battery.. and if there are too many people waiting you cannot help yourself to that last 20% of the battery capacity AT THAT TIME. come back later. 

the amazing thing.. they are COMPLETELY in their legal right to do so. they have promised you an unlimited amount sure. assuming you are a reasonable human being that wouldn't mind sharing when necessary.. but since we we see you all up in arms about this.. we can say.. grab as much supercharging as you need.. you just can't do it right this second.

What, do you feel, makes AP deadly?

In order for the car to crash into something, the driver has to allow it to. The driver can override the steering, acceleration, and braking at any moment.
""

Others have brought up skills atrophy, which is definitely a consideration.

I would also suggest that competent and ""safer"" use of AP requires developing a brand new set of skills - attentive and focused monitoring of AP operation. It is a uniquely different skill set than driving, and without training (which is n/a), leads to over-relying on AP. That over-reliance leads to accidents, and an occasional death.

Over-reliance would be less of a problem if AP was 99+% successful at what it does, and if the remaining 1% of the failure modes were well documented and easy to avoid.

As it is, we are jointly figuring out the conditions that trigger that 1% error states (or 2%, or 5% - who knows), so that we can proactively mitigate them.

I find the need to undertake this task highly undesirable, and an outcome of Tesla's irresponsible lack of communication.

If Tesla were to come forth and share the scenarios where AP is expected to struggle, and how ongoing updates change the probability of triggering those error conditions, my confidence and comfort with AP would be significantly higher. As it is, it's dropping with every public death while driving on AP. 



mongo said:
↑

In pretty much any other car, if the driver relinquishes control to the car, it will be soon be in the ditch or head on into another car. Does that not make AP less deadly?
""

In any other car, relinquishing control of the car would be an insanely stupid and irresponsible thing to do.

In a Tesla on AP, it is the expected thing to do. 

Once AP is engaged, the expect thing is to develop a new skill set of continuously monitor and validate AP's performance without losing focus, or attention. That is not a skill set that any of us were born with, nor have had any practice developing until now.



mongo said:
↑

A system does not need to be 100% to be better than not having it.

AEB/ FCW are assist systems also. If the car has them and still crashes, that is the driver's fault, not the car's.

Airbags do not prevent 100% of fatalities, nor do seat belts. In some types of accidents airbags specifically do not deploy. In sone cases, the airbag deployment increases injury. However, airbags, on the whole, increase safety/ reduces risk of serious injury.
""

I agree with your logic, to a point.
I find EAB/FCW highly unreliable, and either turn them off in my cars (all of them have it, in one form or another), or ignore them.

The key distinction to me is that airbags, like ABS, mitigate consequences of an accident.

AP is in another category of driver's aids, that attempt to prevent the accident in the first place.

TC (traction control) has been doing that in most cars for a few decades now. Drivers have learned to trust TC engagement, as it never fails, or suddenly goes berserk in a middle of a turn. 

If my TC only worked 99% of the time, I would demand to know what the other 1% of the situations are, and how to avoid them. Else, I would find a way to permanently disable unreliable TC.

I have the same concerns with AP.

Over-relying on AP, which is inevitable, can increase the probability of an accident. I did not argue that it does, since I don't have the data (none of us do, and Tesla tight lipped), but without knowing those 1% use-cases, it I can't preclude that possibility that it would.

Again, if Tesla was upfront with sharing that info, I would really appreciate it, and enjoy driving on AP yet again.

As stated above, TOU and NEM are independent things.
[...snip...]
The letter is only talking about what the batteries are doing with respect to the grid. You are always allowed to export all of your solar, whether you have a battery or not. Just imagine if you went on vacation and turned everything off in the house except your fridge. Almost all your solar would go to the grid. They are just going to be checking more closely that you're not using the batteries to charge during off-peak and dump it into the grid during peak to reduce your bill even further.

I don't see any reason not to do your panel upgrade.
""

Thanks, all, for the quick replies! This forum is as fast as the Roadster forum! 

Net net as I hear it —if I upgrade my solar, the Powerwall will not prevent me from exporting to the grid. The NEM letter was really PG&E just putting another block in so that we don‘t arbitrage power rates using battery storage to time-shift the TOU rates (batteries that just happen to be connected to solar). Seems reasonable enough for PG&E to want to prevent that, given their huge TOU rate swings.

One add — for those of us who missed out on the California SGIP (Self Generation Incentive Program) program payments, we don‘t get the tax credit from SGIP, just the 30% federal credit for Solar power generation equipment. (There may still be installers able to get the credit, but not if you go directly through Tesla.)

I wonder if us non-SGIP-credit folks can bypass the programming, and charge off the grid anyways, should we need it? It seems like we should be able to get that turned off.

That said, I haven't seen anyone post the reason and I suspect we won't. It could be that they have seen a bug in the small number of HW3 cars they've rolled it out to and are waiting on another point release before they push it to more. It could just be that they are waiting for HW3 cars and rolling very slowly to them out of an abundance of caution because it's so new. Maybe something else. Only the Tesla engineers know for sure.

The restriction on grid charging is for the federal credit, not for SGIP.

Thanks GerroWong. I am expecting delivery this Friday and am in the exact same situation. Absolutely ridiculous that we are shafted on USB cables, the NEMA 14-50 adapter, and now the purchase price may have increased $550 from when I put my deposit down.

I am preparing a bank draft for $48,489.60, not the website's $49,040.40, and if they make a stink about it then I will simply cancel my order. I'm in no hurry, there's still $5M+ left in the BC EV fund, and the W 4th dealership has still failed to apply my referral code to my order so I probably won't get supercharging with this delivery despite multiple calls and e-mails about it.

I was so, so happy with my test drive in early May, but this delivery process has been horrendous. I couldn't in good conscience recommend any of my friends or family to go through what I've experienced.

yes but it is their SuperCharger network, not yours.

even if we agree that they owe you an unlimited amount of supercharger usage -- which I personally don't, as I see a ""fair use"" issue already coming into play.. but lets assume unlimited supercharging is really the order of the day...

lets say you are entitled to as much free supercharging as you can possibly handle... you are a true road warrior who will spend the rest of his life driving 240 miles back and froth from theoretical supercharger A to supercharger B, non stop.. ad infinitum until the wheels on your Tesla fall off... Tesla promised you this.. they must deliver.. or the knives come out.. not to mention the lawyers. (personally I think this is a very weak argument.. but these are interesting times... who knows how this argument might hold up in court)

you OWN the car.. how you charge it your your business.. ok... i'll play along.

here's the thing you are forgetting:

Tesla never once said they are giving up ownership of WHEN you can supercharge.

so even if they promised you that you can gorge yourself on supercharging electrons to your hearts content... charging to 265 miles on your S85D -- after all you need a buffer for your 240 mile commute drive between SuperChargers A and B.. it's not unreasonable...

but Tesla can tell you WHEN to charge. and in this way, when they need to, and for the good of the entire Tesla community, they are now saying.. ""sorry.. it takes to long to give you those extra 25 miles at the top end of your battery.. and if there are too many people waiting you cannot help yourself to that last 20% of the battery capacity AT THAT TIME. come back later.

the amazing thing.. they are COMPLETELY in their legal right to do so. they have promised you an unlimited amount sure. assuming you are a reasonable human being that wouldn't mind sharing when necessary.. but since we we see you all up in arms about this.. we can say.. grab as much supercharging as you need.. you just can't do it right this second.

it's brilliant. and what's more.. its fair. and it helps everybody.

don't destroy the common pasture b/c you cannot see past the needs of your own cow.
""

Good lord... You clearly refuse to see the damage this insanely stupid policy is going to cause to the brand. Tesla is basically telling people that their battery capacity has been reduced by 20%. For a product that already has inherent issues with range anxiety, why would you do this? 

Furthermore, people made major purchase decisions based on their own usage and availability of supercharger sites. If I need to charge to 100% or 81% or whatever then that's MY decision to make, not Tesla's. If Tesla is going to go with this then it'll only continue to damage the brand and once loyal advocates, such as myself, are given yet another reason to tell people why they should buy anything else but a Tesla. 

I'm so tired of these BS policy mind games Tesla is trying to play and judging by recent delivery numbers, I'm not alone. No matter how you want to cut this, Tesla's current approach is anti-customer. Anti-customer is no way to do business, ever.

It's not brilliant, it's not remotely fair, and no, it most certainly does NOT help everybody... The moment Tesla has actual, serious, competition they are going to evaporate like a fart in the wind. From the Canadian Model 3s who's paint is literally coming off the car, to the other well known quality issues, to the constant lies about AP/EAP/FSD, to the constant price shenanigans, Tesla is going to have a really hard time selling cars if they don't change their ways, fast.

That's a different question. They don't have to publish anything. They provided data to the EPA but the on-screen indications are very nuanced. Technically, Tesla lists them as 50 and 74kWh in internal documentation. Here's a great example: Tesla's 85 kWh rating needs an asterisk (up to 81 kWh, with up to ~77 kWh usable)

Other manufacturers provide various levels of battery specs. Some provide total capacity, some usable, some both. GM advertises the Bolt EV as 60kWh but the sticker on the pack has a 57kWh rating. Under what conditions (c-rate, temp) it was ""rated"" is unknown. Some provide a ""usable"" capacity but it's unknown if that includes a usable buffer below 0 mi.

Thank you for your inquiry. 


You are correct that the “Federal Air Conditioner Tax” will increase the total purchase price of the vehicle to more than $55,000. As a result, the applicable rate of provincial sales tax will be 8%.

The rate of PST you pay on a passenger vehicle that you purchased from a GST registrant (e.g. a motor vehicle dealer) depends on the purchase price of the vehicle:

Purchase Price Rate of PST

Less than $55,000 7%

$55,000—$55,999.99 8%

$56,000—$56,999.99 9%

$57,000—$124,999.99 10%

$125,000—$149,999.99 15%

$150,000 and over 20%


The purchase price is the total price a customer pays to purchase the vehicle before a deduction for a trade-in or down payment, and includes:


Charges for financing, interest, customs and excise
Documentation charges
Service charges
Air conditioning fees and other environmental fees (e.g. tire levies)
Delivery or other transportation charges (including shipping and handling) incurred at or before the time that title to the vehicle passes to the purchaser (see Bulletin PST 302, Delivery Charges)
The value of any services or goods accepted by the seller on account of the purchase price
Charges for warranties, service contracts and maintenance agreements if the warranty, contract or agreement is mandatory (see Bulletin PST 303, Warranties, Service Contracts and Maintenance Agreements)
Amounts paid by third parties as partial or full consideration for the vehicle, such as rebate offers, coupons and other discounts, including cash-back offers, graduation recognitions or credit card rewards, but not manufacturers’ rebates or manufacturers’ coupons (see below)
Accessories, including truck campers that slide-on or mount onto pickup trucks (accessories are generally taxable at a rate of 7% PST)
Any other fees a customer pays to purchase the vehicle
In your scenario the purchase price consists of: $44,999 (Model 3) + $8,701 (Rear Wheel Drive ) + $1,280 (Delivery ) + $100 (Federal Air Conditioner Tax) = $55,080


The estimate you provided below charges 12% “sales tax” on $55,080 for a sum of $6,609.60. It appears that this sale tax percentage includes 7% PST and 5% GST.


However, this is incorrect as you must pay 8% PST as the purchase price of the vehicle is between $55,000—$55,999.99.


As a result, you will need to pay an additional $550.80 in PST (i.e. 1% of the total purchase price).

Well da Erik just did a video on this but it look like they deleted it already ! Sorry wrong video ! They had a Raven X yesterday at my Tesla Showroom and a new S with new dual motor badging which I don’t like

Unfortunately, they compared it to an old S3 it looked like. I wish someone would compare the 2019 pre and 2019 post Ravens. This is such a difficult time to buy. I can get $18,000 off a 2019 without the Raven updates so would really like to know if the new motor, range and suspension will make that much of a difference. It's a big chunk of change. If it was 2000 or less, I wouldn't hesitate. Also, will this Raven update make the earlier 2019 model years depreciate faster and be worth less for future trade-ins etc?

The other appeal of the inventory cars is almost no waiting time.

Hmm. Hopefully some of you who have gotten your Raven vehicles will post how they compare when driven.

Fact is that your ""facts"" are just made up speculation without any basis in actual fact.
None of the traditional automakers have been able to produce anything that comes close to the 2012 Model S. They are 5-10 years behind.
The only expertise they have is in making IC engines and transmissions. Everything else is farmed out. Unfortunately, ICE is obsolete and useless when making EVs so they have to start over. They have been reluctant to make the investment, hoping that EVs would just go away. They are now being forced to make EVs but their starting line is many years behind Tesla. I do hope they get their act together and start making some compelling EVs but I think it will take at least another five years. By then, Tesla will have moved forward another five years.

Also, not sure why Tesla would have cash problems when they make a profit on every car they sell. If they were in the position of VW group, BMW, Mercedes, etc. where they lose money on their pathetically small production, it would be a problem.
""

You need a dose of facts. First: Tesla's real cash position.

Tesla is burning cash. Tesla sold new debt in large part to pay off old debt and the net proceeds of the $2.7 billion raised this month will work out to be only ~$0.8 billion assuming the past debt is paid and Tesla’s working capital balance is put to zero (read the prospectus).

Furthermore, Tesla has been underspending massively in its business. Tesla's publicly announced that its capital expenditure budget for CY 2019 would be $2.0 to $2.5 billion ($680MM per Q), however, Tesla only spent $280MM in Q12019 and $325MM in Q42018. That is a deficit of $750MM. Tesla also spent $27MM less on R&D Q12019 compared to Q12018.

IMO, Tesla decided to forgo spending to save on cash.


Second other car companies commitment to EVs.

VW has announced that it plans to spend $10 billion on EVs by 2023 and have publically upped VW’s global EV sales projections from 15 million vehicles to 22 million over the next decade. VW has also stated that it will spend $800 million to expand its factory in Chattanooga, Tennessee, to handle that crossover and another all-electric model.

Mercedes has stated that they will be launching 10 pure battery-electric vehicles by the end of 2022. Unknown how much $$ they are forecasting to spend outside of China.

As of two months ago, Ford has a new CEO and he is on record stating that Ford plans to spend $11 billion on electrification technology by 2022 to develop 40 new all-electric and hybrid models.

GM basically is nowhere except Bolt, Kia has the Niro, Hyundai has the Kona and IMO, the Bolt is a better car. Honda has cold feet, Toyota’s first all-electric cars will go to China and it is unclear when if ever the USA will see one.

To sum up, Tesla changed the world, has great cars but is underspending and burning cash rapidly every quarter. If Tesla had the cash VW did, it would not be a close race but they don't and IMO, the once silent majority is now picking up speed.",,0,0,0,0

Only thing I'd add is - this potentially helps Fiat by getting it access to Renault (and Nissan) EV technology.

Thanks GerroWong. I am expecting delivery this Friday and am in the exact same situation. Absolutely ridiculous that we are shafted on USB cables, the NEMA 14-50 adapter, and now the purchase price may have increased $550 from when I put my deposit down.

I am preparing a bank draft for $48,489.60, not the website's $49,040.40, and if they make a stink about it then I will simply cancel my order. I'm in no hurry, there's still $5M+ left in the BC EV fund, and the W 4th dealership has still failed to apply my referral code to my order so I probably won't get supercharging with this delivery despite multiple calls and e-mails about it.

They're arguably the world's leading manufacturer, in fact. As far as CTX vs. Pinnacle vs. Stratos, CTX and Pinnacle are very comparable performance wise, but Pinnacle (and Statos) come with a lifetime transferable warranty meaning the warranty is good for the life of the car, not just as long as you own it.

Stratos is obviously a higher performance film for more money. It's enough of a difference over Pinnacle that you will definitely notice, even if it might not look like it on paper. 

Finally, concerning Photosync, that too is a great film, and I have tinted many a Tesla with it. But it's performance is nowhere near as good as Prestige claims. They say it will reject up to 80% total solar energy, which is basically impossible. It may be *slightly* better performing than something like LLumar Stratos or 3M Crystalline, but not enough to justify paying significantly more for it.

Many of my customers opt for 35% on all the side windows and back window. It's a nice, clean look, and I really like how the back window looks from the outside with that shade.

Upon searching online, I was surprised that I still couldn't find an exact number (55 kwh?, 54 kwh?, 50 kwh?). People have posted about their guestimate etc. but nothing that says for sure what size battery the car comes with. Can someone please educate me or point me to the right place? This should be so obvious for a car that has battery as a key component and I am at a loss that I am missing the obvious.

One other question, I couldn't find information from Tesla about which states are charged by minute for Supercharging. I am in NJ and I ""think"" based on other posts from past that NJ superchargers rates are by minute (0.13 or 0.26) but no easy way to confirm what is the current situation (per minute or per kwh cost) for NJ. How about listing of which states charge how? Does anyone know?

I’ve also owned Mercedes, BMWs, Fords, Chevy Subaru’s etc. rarely did I ever not find SOME minor paint issue. I will confirm BMW and Mercedes did fix them. I was told once by a Ford body shop that my $40k FOrd SHO must have been a “Friday” car because the front fenders were so misaligned, it was sad. They corrected it along with paint issues. All this from Ford—the master of US car manufacturers. I’ve had one of my Model S s undergo serious paint correction from highway paint splatter. And I can confirm that the clear coat cut off and what was left was no different than any other car. Maybe they are cheapo on the Model 3 but side by side it does not seem so. It seems the paint in wheel issue may be valid. 

I am not defending Tesla’s course of actions with the Model 3. I’ve experienced other issues that infuriate me. But I do think the paint issue is being massively over hyped.

Another lesson, new cars depreciate fast. Well, nothing new here either. A new car that drives off the lot, loses approximately 2 years worth of depreciation, which is 25-50% of its value, depending on which car. Think about differently, let's say we look at $100K Model S. Say it costs Tesla $70K to produce one (not including R&D and all the other overhead, because they are irrelevant for example as they are fixed total cost). A customer after a month of ownership want's to return it, so Tesla is facing a question of how much is the car worth to them? They can make a brand new one, custom color and options, for $70K, so obviously the car with fixed options and a month worth of use (and not eligible for new EV rebates) has to be worth a less. Value, or worth, of a car is always what you can get someone else to pay for it. There is no absolute or somehow ""fair"" value.

I also didn't realize that looping the charge cable through the attic space and returning to reduce length would do the same. Seemed so harmless until Eprosenx quoted the 2017 NEC. If I appear thin skinned, I'm not. There's a correct way to correct and critique, since we're all here to share and learn. This in my opinion, is a poor example.

Not a fan. Why would you go away from ONR back to the hassle of soap and a pressure washer? Big waste of time and water. Also, are you not using 2 buckets with a grit guard in each to clean your wash mitt after each panel? If not, you're slowly going to damage the surface (be it ceramic, PPF, etc). You need to keep your wash media clean. And soap only lubricates the surface as long as soap is actually present and wet... most of your foam had fallen off the car by the time you tried washing the entire car, and soap in sunlight is a horrible idea (it dries and loses its lubrication properties), hence another benefit of ONR (can easily wash in your garage).

- works well for lane changes although you need to initiate it with the indicator and there's the 5 second rule where if it hasn't changed lane in 5 seconds it cancels. So you basically need to wait for a gap before doing it. 

- works well on motorways and dual carriageways 

- it can't handle roundabouts so goes back to regular autopilot for roundabouts 

- it can't handle rain, so goes back to regular autopilot 

- on approaching an exit on the motorway, it knows you need to come off, so it indicates on its own, then starts to pull onto the exit ramp, then decides to pull back onto the main motorway really abruptly. It happened at every exit I tried it on so clearly needs to be fixed in software. I think it's because it loses sight of the lane markings. It would be awesome if it worked.

AP is in another category of driver's aids, that attempt to prevent the accident in the first place.
""

And this is the crux of the problem. There is no way to tell how many accidents AP prevents, so there is only a one sided measurement (the times it doesn't prevent an accident).
""

Agreed with the above observation, but it's not the crux of the problem. It is the consequence of Tesla not sharing those data points, except in the form of the most high-level and self-congratulatory summaries.

To me, the crux of the problem is lack of data, and lack of communication from Tesla.
Without that data, my statistically insignificant observations are as follows:

I haven't had an at-fault accident in decades before getting a Tesla, or since. Therefore, the objective marginal safety value of Tesla's AP, to me, is zero. 
The convenience and commuting comfort values are clearly positive. But at a price. The less focused I am on driving and supervising AP, the greater the convenience and commuting comfort benefits!
My early over-reliance on AP has led me into far too many emergency disengagements, or ""oh sh*t"" situations, in which AP would have caused an accident had I not intervened. Thus the subjective net safety impact on my driving experience has initially been marginally negative, though I'm learning to mitigate that by reducing my over-reliance on AP. 
I'm learning to pro-actively avoid ""AP fail"" conditions with the help of personal experience, and through shared experience from folks on this and other forums, but with zero help or instruction from Tesla.
So far, AP's value proposition to me is a trade-off: improved commuting comfort at the expense of marginal subjective decrease in safety. I am working on maintaining the former while mitigating the latter, but it's very much a work in progress.

A counter-argument to the above would be: AP is the savior, and an average Tesla driver would have crashed long ago had they not been driving on AP. 

May be that's true. Then again, we don't have the data to argue one way or the other.

I'm with you on that one. I've been driving a 2017 Mustang GT the past 2.5 years. The thing does NOT like wet roads - and I live in the Sacramento area where the rain is nothing like the NW.

That's kept me on the road and away from paint-swaps, but doesn't keep my heart from wrapping itself around my throat. I've long trained myself not to put in sudden, extreme inputs unless warranted. Still, the one time it broke free on a wet clover leaf freeway interchange, with my daughter on board and the top down, was enough to reevaluate whether it's worth keeping the thing.

The other day my wife and I went to the store. We were on a rural road, wide and well marked. An oncoming car had slowed to a stop or nearly stopped. Then it turned left, crossed our path and entered a driveway. It was far enough away that had it stopped in the middle of my lane I would have had time to stop without using maximum braking force. I let it go without braking at all and I did this pretty much unconsciously. This is what I think my computer (brain) did in this situation:

* Oncoming vehicle detected in left lane ahead, stopped or nearly stopped. Unusual, so dedicate an additional 200,000 neurons to monitor this.
* Vehicle advanced into my lane and is headed straight for me. Path of vehicle is curved and projected path and speed will take it out of a collision threat if it continued. Watch closely.
* Computed time to collision if vehicle stops in my lane is 4.8 seconds. Maximum braking time for full stop to avoid collision is 3.2 seconds. Waited 1 second before applying brakes to see what vehicle does.
* Vehicle continued along its projected curved path, still partially in my lane but now the vehicle cannot stop in my lane due to its forward speed and its reasonable braking power.
* Continued driving without braking.

There was no collision or threat of collision and passenger remained calm. If I was using TACC it would have panicked at the first sign that the oncoming vehicle was in my lane (dumping that bag of groceries in the back seat and prompting a scream into my right ear), regardless if the vehicle was on a path that would take it out of a collision threat within time for my car to brake to a full stop. I'm not saying ""if I can do this why can't Tesla"", but I am puzzled as to why this seems to be so difficult. Tesla does so many other things that require some heavy computin' so why not this? It's got the required information to do so.

Just wondering.
""

This is an incredibly complex set of problems to solve. You've got to:

- create a 3d map of your surroundings 
- identify all objects of interest in that map
- forecast the future state of the 3d space many time steps ahead, including your own relative position to all identified objects 
- decide if anything in your forecast is a risk 
- if a risk is identified, you have to take an action
- the potential space for taking action is large so you have to optimize the action to the particular circumstance

And then you have to do this for a really hugely wide array of conditions. The ability to handle this well is really, really hard and there are tons of different strategies for breaking down and solving the problem. 

Contrast this with a much simpler task: follow a car in front of you at a distance of 100ft. Then what you have to do is:

- identify if there is a car in front of you
- compute the distance to the car
- subtract the distance from 100ft, call that the error 
- make a speed adjustment that is proportional to the error",,0,0,0,0

Is your drive formatted FAT32? If it's formatted as NTFS or exFAT; the Tesla software won't recognize it; that could explain why you don't see the dashcam icon on the screen.

My wife (driver for over 40 years, no accidents, no tickets) was stopped at a traffic light on a downgrade, foot on the brake, in our brand new Tesla Model 3 when it suddenly began to move forward and crashed into cars stopped at the light in front of her. My wife tried desperately to stop the Tesla with the brakes and emergency brake. She was helpless as the car was uncontrollable and would not respond to her actions. The party that was hit called the police who showed up in force because the Tesla was essentially using her car as a brake as her car moved forward. The police were very rough with my wife as if she had done something criminal, adding to her trauma. The other party reported injuries and we and our insurance are on the hook for a crash that was not our fault. I hate to think of what could have happened had there not been cars there to stop my wife in the Tesla. We purchased the Tesla in December of 2018 and the crash occurred in February of 2019. After the crash I called Tesla, then I went to their showroom in San Diego. They brushed me off and referred me to Teslalegal.com. So I asked my attorney to help. In the meantime, after the Tesla was released from the body shop it was sent to the Tesla Service Center in San Diego. Immediately, my attorney emailed [email protected] for Tesla to preserve and provide the Electronic Driving Record to determine what happened to the car. After two weeks she received an email reply advising us to contact the local Service Center for that information. My attorney then tried to contact the Service Center rep via a text number given to me but was ignored. When I told the Tesla rep my attorney was trying to contact them I was told they couldn’t talk to her and that the Tesla Legal Team would be in contact. At this point Tesla definitely knows that we have a problem. Our attempts at contact began immediately after the crash in February. As of May 15th there is no contact yet. With the knowledge that I had an attorney, Tesla service still sent me documents to sign. They recently sent me a text that they have “updated firmware with the latest version” and the car “is safe to drive at this time.” To me it sounds like they modified the Tesla. My attorney has called and emailed Tesla Service, Tesla Customer Service, Tesla Legal, and Tesla Headquarters in Fremont. She has written letters and sent them by email to all of the above and mailed them certified mail. In the letters she has explained that my wife and I are fearful of driving the car and definitely don’t want anyone else to get hurt. She has asked that they contact her to discuss the matter. There is no response from Tesla. We struggled to buy this car. We are seniors and wanted a nice, safe, dependable car. We are afraid to drive the car for fear that someone could be seriously hurt or even killed. The Tesla sits in the Service Center storage. Now we have no car and Tesla has our substantial money. Tesla obviously doesn’t care.

3696686,Can I convert NEMA 5-15 to NEMA 6-20,wyldtek,2019-05-27 16:31:00,"CUBldr97 said:
↑

so you have to have more details as to why the cost of $3200. I ran a run over 75ft and a nema 14-50 and a circuit breaker... parts was under $200. If your only way to do this is external then add a few hundred for conduit. If he needs to add another panel, no room for a breaker, or up the power to the house then maybe $3200 is reasonable. Like others have said, get a few more electricians to come to the house and get estimates, and ask specifically how they are figuring out the cost. Labor is probably $100 and hour give or take.
""

The quote I got last year was also a little over $3k. Only had 5-15 in the garage but its a 20 amp circuit so I switched one outlet to 5-20. The increase in charging speed to ~5 mph for the MX and ~7 mph for the M3 has been more than adequate for us. I don't see a need to spend the money required to upgrade any further. If my needs changed later, would consider switching one outlet to a dedicated circuit and upgrading it to 6-20.

As for details on the high estimate from the electrician, it's mostly labor. The sub panel is inside the house so would require running lines though the ceiling and multiple walls.
From the old estimate:
* from interior sub panel, open wall in closet and ceiling to bedroom closet. Bore holes through studs, nail plates
and joists for conductor. Thread 4/3 Romex from existing 150 amp sub panel through studs and joists to stub
through with 1” flex steel in Laundry area. Stub through with 1” flex to back of pull station in garage. Splice
Romex and continue with 1” emt along garage wall to front corner of garage to new sub panel. Run ¾” emt to (N)
junction box with NEMA 14-50 plug land on 50 amp breaker.

If I'm entitled for expecting my Final Price Sheet to be accurate, then call me entitled. And yes, I do think CEV funds will last:

I think the most annoying part about the Tesla community is that certain people cannot handle any criticism whatsoever. These are not no-frills offerings or spartan cars from low-cost carriers. Even the cheapest Tesla costs over a year's salary for the average person in the Lower Mainland. If you want to charge a premium price, why would you be surprised when people complain at less-than-premium service and quality?
""

Having a final price is fair. Cheapest Tesla is the cheapest for a reason, but here you are expecting they give you everything. Floormats, USB cables, 14-50 adapter, referral credits and maybe premium sound too? As for taxes they are supposed to charge you 13% as spelled out by the BC govt. If Tesla is working with people on making that 12% then all power to them.

If CEV tops up, awesome and if you can wait maybe they will make cars cheaper and include the things you are looking for then. It's happened to me, if I were to configure today it would've saved me a few thousand plus get FSD.

Tesla abandoned your advice and it has started installing in a separate 12V battery since Roadster 2.0 until now with S, X, and 3.

.. for some people... for others, like myself there are no problems with Spotify. I had no issues before V9 and none after either.
""

As best as I've been able to narrow things down where it all falls apart is when the car is on WiFi (my garage) and it turns on with Spotify selected. Once I leave home and it has to change over from WiFi to 3G if that doesn't go smoothly then it will not work again. Doesn't matter if it gets WiFi again or full bars of 3G, car is turned off all night etc, once that handover fails the MCU requires a reboot for Spotify to work again.

I have tried clearing out the playlists as well, for me it makes no difference. But I know I am not alone in the misery of endlessly trying to have Spotify functional for more than a few days, consider yourself lucky because it is so infuriating and knowing it'll probably never get sorted makes it worse.
I remember the firmware 2018.48.12.1 (I think it was that one) that actually caused the MCU to reboot by itself if you tried to use Spotify, that hit many people and took them ages to fix. It is worrying that you say you've had no issues with Spotify at all and yet here was plenty of people that had the 2018.48.12.1 reset bug. They only have to have this working on a few different hardware configurations so how that sort of thing happens I have no idea.",,0,0,0,0

You do realize that those stats are incredibly biased right?

It's biased for the following reasons :
1. There are significantly fewer Tesla's on the road compared to other cars
2. Those buying a Tesla are a very specific demographic that is statistically more likely to be a good or safe driver
3. The sample size is still too small

You should take these stats for what they are: an early predictive measure of what it could be but no means accurate or definitive
""


Negatory.

The fact that there are fewer Tesla’s on the road is irrelevant. The statistics are given per million miles driven. A mile driven in a Tesla is the same as a mile driven in an ice.

How can you support thot two? Where is your evidence to support that? Even if we assume it to be true, the statics also compare tesla drivers without auto pilot to Tesla drivers with autopilot, and Tesla drivers with autopilot go twice as far without getting into an accident as Tesla drivers without autopilot.

You also can’t prove thot three either. Most studies limit thier sample size to somewhere between 100 and 2000 samples (due to cost)... suffice it to say there are more than 2000 Tesla’s on the road that have driven sufficient miles to develope a sample size that provide a relatively high confidence level on the safety of the vehicles auto pilot system.

I also totally disagree with the title.
The nav is great and the best around.
It sure can be improved and waypoina t would be nice. But not essential. Nothing prevents you to plan your route and chose as destination the next stop you want in the nav.
And indeed if you want to plan, you can do it with abetterrouteplanner.com

I find it not constructive such arbitrary judgement totally unbalanced.
In my previous Audi there was waypoint. But the system was really poor at routing, obsolete out of the box and of course not updating unless you paid for a 2 years old outdated update. And the waypoints turned out cumbersome and I dropped using them.

Please be more mindful before judging.
I’m sure Tesla people are reading and this is not constructive.

I liked the title for it got peoples attention, I want people to have a discussion on the good, bad and ugly. the feedback is a wild suggestion, for I have had my car 3 months, I made 2 suggestions before delivery and 3 since. I have had a canned response to all of them. 'thank you for your consideration, you suggestion will be forwarded to the proper department for due consideration"" I am sure the people who took 2 weeks to work out that response think that will hold us over. the Nav in my 2016 Subaru outback worked better, easier and more responsive than Tesla's I have made two trips in my Tesla so far over 1500 miles each. Its a lot harder to plan a trip in a Tesla then a gas car but to add in the fact I have to break up my trip into 4 tinny segments because the nav wants to use on rout only. I miss getting 2 or 3 suggested routs from my old systems. AND no WAZE support is nuts too, and yes i used [email protected] for that before I even had my car delivered. 
People says ""Tesla review these forums too"" if so, I say send me a PM but lets be honest, since they didn't call me for my service appointment or for deliver of my car, why would they call me to discuss how to make my Navigation operate better?",,0,0,0,0

1. Can you provide info on which cases?

2. Was Tesla found at fault in any cases you worked on?

3. Don’t you think putting the vehicle in neutral (along with the brakes) is the proper method to handle an unintended acceleration on the highway?

4. In the cases of Teslas running into the walls, do you think that at those speeds while parking, the brakes would have been sufficient?

5. Since Teslas don’t have the vacuum situation, does your brake example still apply?

Any Autopilot Tesla has the iBooster, which means as long as it has 12V power it has full brake boost available - there's basically a motor geared to the master cylinder piston.

Excellent trip report! Thanks for taking the time to offer so much detail 

If you decide to make this trip again, Be aware that there is a J1772 charging station (not free) at Cascade Market in Castle Rock WA at 204 W. Cowlitz Ave. You'll need an adapter for your mobile cord (my CPO MS came with this adapter). Details can be found at https://pluginamerica.org and find what's available in your area on the map.

More good charging info in WA can be found at Plug-In North Central Washington. We used their facility in Winthrop at the Pine Near Campground. Wonderful folks there even offered to watch our dogs while we walked the 2 blocks into town for a brew with local family.

I'll be back in WA for a relocation scouting trip in July/August. DM me and I'll buy you a coffee - or maybe something stronger 

Thanks again, and happy trails!

3696807,First Tesla M3 SR+ road trip,bogich,2019-05-27 17:28:00,"I've been driving my M3 SR+ for the last 2 months, mainly commuting 36 miles a day and weekend city driving. I bought it as a commuter car and never considered it as good road trip car. My line of thought was - buy the lower priced Tesla as a commuter and run the SUV on the long trips.

Well, last weekend I change my mind! Besides, being on the smaller size for the party of 4(with 2 days worth of personal luggage), the car did great. Not in a moment I had to wait on the car to charge - it was done way before we finished refueling ourselves. For the 593 miles from D.C. to NYC and back(plus some NYC driving), I had to stop twice at a supercharger, where I paid total of $13.

Starting at 100% from home - first charge took about 30 min after 198 miles off driving and I charged more than I needed. I had a free destination charger at the hotel in NYC, but I didn't even fully used the service, since for two nights I only topped off about 25% each night. Second charge on the way back took about 20 min, since this time I new I didn't have to wait more and I still came back home with 23% to spare.

So there you have it - if anyone have any doubt, whether SR+ is good enough for this type of weekend getaway - don't hesitate anymore - save your $10k and get the SR+

Negatory.

The fact that there are fewer Tesla’s on the road is irrelevant. The statistics are given per million miles driven. A mile driven in a Tesla is the same as a mile driven in an ice.

How can you support thot two? Where is your evidence to support that? Even if we assume it to be true, the statics also compare tesla drivers without auto pilot to Tesla drivers with autopilot, and Tesla drivers with autopilot go twice as far without getting into an accident as Tesla drivers without autopilot.

You also can’t prove thot three either. Most studies limit thier sample size to somewhere between 100 and 2000 samples (due to cost)... suffice it to say there are more than 2000 Tesla’s on the road that have driven sufficient miles to develope a sample size that provide a relatively high confidence level on the safety of the vehicles auto pilot system.

Again, wrong facts.
""

You're still missing the point. Tesla cars and owners are not representative of a sufficiently random and diverse group to be considered a quality sample for a statistical study. It doesn't really matter the actual numbers or how many miles driven. There are simply too many biased variables to be able to show real Autopilot effectiveness. If you can't understand why that is true then you don't understand how scientific studies are designed nor statistical significance works.

The stats that your ""facts"" are based on is equivalent to a study that attempts to measure the average weight of all people in the world by selecting a sample of people that all live in the same town.

To them, they are already concerned about range anxiety, and this action just makes them more nervous about buying a Tesla.

To add insult to injury, there are now stories that Tesla is asserting that the yellow border on the model S and X touchscreen is “cosmetic” and that the touchscreens will not be replaced, that the paint on the model 3 is not holding up in Canada and parts of Europe, and that Tesla is delivering cars (model 3) with paint defects that they refuse to correct. All these stories (whether true or not) will have an adverse effect on sales and by extension, the survivability of the company. As a shareholder that concerns me. The solution is not to limit the charging limit (which they seem to have done this holiday weekend everywhere, even when a supercharger location has less than 50% utilization), but to add additional superchargers. Their action may save some money at the moment but will cost them (in lost sales) in the future. People buy Teslas because they are fun to drive, they had a perceived 250+ mile range (prior to the charge limit being implemented) and the supercharger network. People are not buying them because they are as luxurious as a comparatively priced MB or BMW (because they are not).

Keep in mind that Tesla has been deficient in building chargers since the beginning. There were supposed to be 1000 US supercharger locations by the end of 2017. Then it became a doubling of the network (eg, more than 1000) by the end of 2018. At their current rate of construction there will still not be 1000 US supercharger locations by the end of 2019. Further, some routes are still not complete. For example, it still is not possible to travel between Memphis TN and Oklahoma City in any Tesla vehicle. I understand it costs money to build a supercharger site, but it is the supercharger network that drives sales. Don’t skimp on it for short term savings as it only gives people more reasons NOT to buy s Tesla.",,0,0,0,0

Just wondering what.... Why we (as humans) can evaluate the above scenario better than a computer? Computers have a hard time telling the difference between things like an inflatable car and a real one, while we humans would not have such trouble. The reason computers are ""better"" drivers than humans is because we dont pay attention (at least not 100%). If all humans devoted 100% of their concentration to driving when they are driving, Its my belief that we would be better than any computer by a LOONG shot.

We dont, however, even when by ourselves, and even when NOT fiddling with phones, and music and such. We ""think about stuff"" when we drive... we listen to audio books, we talk to other humans... and thats all before we get to the people who eat things that require utensils while driving. 

True story.. just two days ago, while my wife and I were taking a trip from Temecula to San Marcos to look at smokers in a BBQ store, on the freeway, whie, traffic was going 80 miles an hour, we saw a man, in a minivan, with 2 kids in car seats in the back, ""driving"" with a fast food cup in his left hand, and a burger in his right hand. He basically had his wrists on the steering wheel, in an older minivan, driving 2 kids, at 80+ miles an hour.

THATS why computers are better drivers than us right now, because there is always someone on the road doing something like that.

3696880,Q for Electrical Gurus,NickFie,2019-05-27 17:57:00,"It looks like it would work. Car will charge slowly. For example, my wife drove our S100D to our daughter's apartment last Thursday. Her then-fiancee, now husband, connected Mobile Connector to a 120 Volt 5-15 receptacle. The car charged at 12 Amps, limit for continuous operation of the 15 Amp rated outlet. The battery added 19 KWH over the following 18 hours.

Cautions:

- The receptacle appears to be exposed to weather. It may no longer be able to safely handle its rated electric load. Proceed with caution. Electrician's fee to review and renew the arrangement is likely to be a small fraction of cost to repair damage from electrical fire.

- Adapter rated at 10 Amps. The Model 3 5-15 adapter will pull up to 12 Amps, which could overheat the receptacle or adapter. You can use the outlet to charge your car with the following procedure:

A. Before attaching cable, bring up charging menu.

B. Enable Scheduled Charging. Specify start time a few hours in the future. You can change this later, the step ensures charging will not start until you've configured the car.

C. Insert receptacle adapter, then connect Mobile Connector with complementary 5-15 adapter. Finally, connect Mobile Connector with the car's charge port.

D. Return to charge menu in car. Set maximum current to 10 Amps, it likely shows 12 Amps as max. Note whether display shows 120 Volts or 2x0 Volts (220 or 240).

E. Disable scheduled charging. Charge will start after some seconds, current draw will ramp up slowly.

F. Check receptacle and adapter for overheating using the back of your hand, which is more sensitive. If you can find the lead connecting receptacle to breaker panel, check it with the back of your hand. Check at the start and then every 15 minutes for the first hour.
- Warm, but you can comfortably press your hand against it for 10 or 15 seconds, if acceptable.
- Too hot to rest to press the back of your hand, or burning smell? Discontinue charging immediately.​
- Not a problem if receptacle provides 220/240 Volts. The adapters can handle it, your car will charge at slightly more than twice the speed.

No I dont. Have thought about it several times but the plan I am currently under lets me use SCE basically like a big powerwall itself. If I could actually get a powerwall (2 actually) without months long wait, I would probably have them anyway.

Doesnt sound like much (roughly 48 or so hours), but this was early january, it gets to mid to high 30s during the night here in temecula then, and obviously no heat, etc. 48 hours felt like 2 weeks.

And everyone always thinks that they are never ever capable of making a mistake in their lives. 
I also know how to set the charge limit, but are you always going to be on your game and alert and paying attention enough to remember in the moment?
I was on a trip to Portland with friends a few years ago, and they decided they wanted to wait until after work to leave. Well great. It's about a 9-10 hour trip, so that was going to put us there very late. We were renting a house through AirBNB there. So when we got there about 2 or 3 in the morning, I was pretty tired and a little irritable. The house had a driveway...ish. It was unbelievably narrow, with these prickly evergreen bushes tight along both sides. I could only back about a third of the way into the driveway without scraping the bushes.

There was a 10-30 dryer outlet, but it was in a laundry room in the basement. So I am getting out my 30 foot 14-50 extension cord and dragging that up the driveway and in the pet door in the side of the kitchen and down the stairs to the laundry room, and it doesn't quite reach, so I'm straightening out the cord where it comes down the stairs to get that extra couple of feet, and I'm getting more frustrated. And then it's still a foot or two short. So I go back out to the car, and back it a little farther up the driveway. SKREEEEEEEEE as I hear the bushes scraping along both sides of my car, I'm cringing and about throwing a fit. It's already stupid late, and I wanted to be in bed; not fighting with this crap. So I finally have enough length, and I get it plugged in, and I am feeling so exhausted and relieved but still irritated and definitely distracted and just want to be f%$^ing done with this thing. So I open the door to make sure it's at least running, and it's starting to ramp up the current, and very forunately, at that moment, I remember that I'm using a 10-30 to 14-50 pigtail adapter, so the current isn't set right, so I quickly jump in the car to turn it down to about 21A.

So yes, I am knowledgeable and capable about this kind of thing, but tiredness happens. Distractions happen. Multi-tasking and trying to remember to do 3 or 4 things at once when you arrive happens and forgetting things can happen. People aren't perfect, and the human brain isn't perfect. A culmination of things can sometimes cause you to not quite think as quickly and clearly as you think you would.

If you've seen me on this forum, I'm not one of the people who flippantly tells people to throw away hundreds or thousands of dollars on more expensive charging setups because ""You spent $XXXXXX on this car, so what's another $XXX?"" I don't recommend wasting money for no good reason. But $50 for a bit of safety margin to cover a possible problem? Yeah, I think that's fairly worth it, and I certainly don't arrogantly criticize people who would recommend it like you two are doing.
""

It's the very infrequency of the adapter's use that lends itself to errors.

When I put together my charging kit, I deliberately bought extension cords and adapters that would not allow me to plug into something that wouldn't supply the amperage my UMC would automatically demand. I did this for exactly the scenario you state: I would likely be somewhere unfamiliar, late, tired, and feeling pressure to get the juice flowing. Remembering to de-rate the charger would have a high probability of getting missed.

To eliminate the chance of this dangerous error, $50 is nothing. I've spent that on two cocktails. To neglect to use such an inexpensive fail safe is the definition of hubris.

The screen shows it as an SR+, but the range was definitely capped at 220 miles. There was no fog light option. Immersive sounds was available but just “on/off”, I thought the stereo sounded great but I didn’t spend a lot of time listening to it. It was built in May and had HW3. 

There was no window sticker on the car so I asked them to print one out for me. It seemed like a foreign request but they seemed happy to do so. The window sticker definitely said “SR” and 220 miles range. 

The J1772 adapter was included as was the 120 volt adapter. No other adapters were included and no phone cables were included. No floor mats (as expected).

Tesla is always ""in a very serious situation"". That's how they grow the business as fast as they do, and why I'm driving a Tesla rather than yet another Ford --after two different Mondeo, an S-Max and a Focus, with some VW and Audi thrown in between the Fords.
""

Ok, so you are a fan of Tesla. That doesn't mean anything about how likely they are to be successful. They had a sketchy streak trying to get the model 3 production up at volume. But I don't think that was a big risk. The biggest risk was that Musk might screw it up rather than letting his people solve the problems. In spite of it all there was really just a three month or so delay getting the car production numbers up to what they needed to be and they did, big whoop! 

Now they have a two year window where they need to get two factories up and running. Lots of costs and with their track record no one is expecting them to meet any sort of a schedule, not that Tesla is really committing to much. The commitment is not the issue, the revenue stream is. Once they start hiring at each factory they will have very large costs and need to get cars out the door in the hands of customers who want them in order to bring in money to pay those salaries. Two factories, two years. That's a much bigger risk than anything they have done so far. 




And Tesla were getting my money partly because I want car companies navel-staring at their ICE business to transition to electric vehicles yesterday, instead of ""maximising shareholder value"" while messing up the environment. They need someone like Tesla to eke them on, and buying a Tesla is my contribution (but hey, I get a nice car in the process).
""

Tesla is doing a wonderful job of ""eking"" them on... or were. Now that their finances are in the dumper the other companies are watching closely to see just how much demand there is for the model 3 and will be watching for the model Y. 

When I researched why we don't have thorium reactors in the US I found there is a huge economic barrier. The first company to jump all the hurtles of the NRC will have very, very high costs to do that. They refer to it by saying this is an area where everyone wants to be second. LIkewise the other companies are happy to let Tesla be the ground breaker to make all the mistakes while making very little or no profit. The other companies can avoid Tesla's mistakes and come into the market second or third and do a much better job of making a profit. 

The majority of car buyers don't actually want the ""revolution"" that Tesla brings. They want cars that work, work reliably and don't have problems with charging. Even today there are many issues with owning a Tesla EV when it comes to getting them charged. Most owners are in denial, just waiving off the issues since they usually only find them to be minor inconveniences. But the majority of car owners don't want to sacrifice anything for EVs. 




Mind you, Ford is also in a very serious situation, as is BMW, but with a lethargic response rather than an aggressive and risky drive to grow. And Fiat-Chrysler isn't really on a bed of roses either.

The TL;DR version:

I'm in Vancouver.


Was sent to pick-up location on the wrong day

Was given the incorrect total for a bank draft

Picked up SR+ 3/30 after having been convinced it would be well worth paying the difference between it and the SR due to the SR having manual seats, mirrors, cloth seats, no centre console or USB, 32km less range, no heated seats, no fog lights, no live traffic data or sat maps.(All lies apart from the last point, which the SR+ has never had anyway).

Car was not inspected

Car was dirty (did not see it until way after paying and completing insurance due to the zoo it was that day)

Also, after quadruple and triple checking if they would ever be eligible for the upcoming federal rebate I was told: absolutely not

Paid >~$59,300 which included paying $4000 for AP, after provincial rebate. Bumped into luxury tax of 14% for basic black/black SR+

Days later they integrated AP and lowered the price such that there would be no luxury tax

Then they started releasing the SR as the SR+, the SR having never existed, for a much lower price


They didn't apply referral until after maybe 20 emails/calls, then I received 1500km. A couple of days after it was changed to 7500km.
(They have yet to honour their statement that owners lied to about the SR would be able to 'downgrade' to it)
30 days after purchase they suddenly release a compliance car, priced under the federal cutoff

The SR/SR+ scam worked out to costing me just under $5000. That includes the price difference and tax difference.

The federal rebate 30 days after I bought my car cost me about $7000.

Hope that makes some of you feel less ripped off by the every-lying and dishonourable Tesla.

They fail to respond to 90% of communication attempts, and when they do it's with misinformation, or passing-the-buck.

The car is amazing. It really is. But I cancelled my order for PY and have to think long and hard about dealing with Tesla again. I still recommend the Model 3 SR+ as it's the safest car, doesn't pollute, drives well etc., but if there was a different company with a superior product I'd go to them instead. At this time I'm considering the Rivian R1S, since the 3 was a temporary car for me. I'm glad I got to see how Tesla really is.

Of note, I'm a shareholder, and Tesla evangelist since 2006. This was a rough knock to say the least.

Anyway, there's the short version of my story.
""

It's sad to hear that's still the case today. Many have gone through what you went through last year. End of the day many of my friends bought the car for the car, not for the service.

Not a fan. Why would you go away from ONR back to the hassle of soap and a pressure washer? Big waste of time and water. Also, are you not using 2 buckets with a grit guard in each to clean your wash mitt after each panel? If not, you're slowly going to damage the surface (be it ceramic, PPF, etc). You need to keep your wash media clean. And soap only lubricates the surface as long as soap is actually present and wet... most of your foam had fallen off the car by the time you tried washing the entire car, and soap in sunlight is a horrible idea (it dries and loses its lubrication properties), hence another benefit of ONR (can easily wash in your garage). You'd be much better off using an IK Foam sprayer with your soap and going at each panel one by one.

First of all, proof is in the putting, after 14 months, our cars look Showroom new with Zero swirl marks. I cannot say the same for my first Tesla which I used only ONR on. If you insist on using ONR, DO NOT USE A 2 BUCKET GRItT GUARD METHOD.

It is worth noting that this exit had some serious construction work not too long ago. In fact Google Maps still shows the old exit. So I suspect this is a maps issue, not a NOA issue per se. If the map is off, it would explain why NOA was recommending incorrect lane changes. I definitely have not had this experience with other exits.

Hopefully, if Tesla is able to move to a more vision based NN with AP3, that will solve this issue.
""

That is possible. I've had the experience of the car changing the speed limit from 55 to 25 at a new overpass for months after it was complete because during the construction they used the new ramp lanes as by-passes at 25 MPH. I still don't know if the maps have caught up, but it was a bit scary when the car would do a hard speed reduction for no apparent reason on a highway.

↑

I also bought in dec 2018

I love the EAP.
And I’ll consider what’s coming out but for now am pretty happy.

I’m an airline pilot, and one of the most unexpected things I’ve run across are the intelligent conversations with EAP Tesla owners relating the levels of automation to what’s in the airliner. How different scenarios require different levels of automation - I’ll click through all the levels several times on my 25 minute drive home- especially since i ride motorcycles and that makes me compelled to not always want to be dead center in my lane- i give them as much room as i like to give the person in 1995 Camry who’s clearly texting driving with his knee and drifting over to my side. I don’t trust other drivers as far as i can throw them and just don’t want to test Tesla’s jerky response when i can smoothly give them another foot or two to the other side of my lane. Raising or lowering the level of automation for where you are is very much like what we do in the air. But there’s no time where you get to tune out.
And when the lightbulb goes on and they realize that “the airplanes really don’t fly themselves do they?” ‘No more than you’re not really important at this point in your Tesla’. Obviously a lot of the automation in my airliner was developed in the 90’s and passengers and regulators are a lot less tolerant of an airline crash that an auto crash, but it’s nice to have non pilot people start to gain that understanding.
You drive and fly with your mind- the rest is efficiency, reducing fatigue, and giving yourself some valuable seconds adding up to minutes, where the automation can handle it and you don’t have to be hyper vigilant til you’re exhausted.

The crime itself is usually carried out in less than a minute; one suspect keeps a lookout, another smashes the car window and grabs any available goods, and a third acts as getaway driver. Then the crew flees to another neighborhood, looking for its next victim. In other cases, gang members work in larger groups and will sometimes hit every car on a single block before fleeing.

Breaking into homes, meanwhile, can result in a violent encounter with a resident and heavier sentences for those who are convicted. But to be sentenced for any crime, you first must be arrested.

I had no idea that Tesla could just selectively and dynamically decide what's in warranty and what isn't, but I guess they can!

If I do decide to pay to get my screen replaced tomorrow, I fully expect the fanboys in this forum to thank me greatly for donating to The Cause, since I'm paying Tesla a profit for maintaining status-quo through no fault of my own on a <6 mo old vehicle.

The article described the one in Tesla owner's manual which also happened to me in real life.

The black car in front of me saw stopped cars in front so it moved to the right.

I was driving with Autopilot version 8.1 at 61 MPH and didn't immediately understand why the black car in front changed to the right lane.

I knew that the black car changed lane but I didn't realize I was in danger driving at 61 MPH in a stopped traffic in front.

I was still thinking!

I only realized the danger when the Collision Warning Alarm went off and and told myself ""there's no time to think any more!""

I applied the brakes thanks to the alarm.

I could have applied the brake on my own without the alarm but it might be a tad late because I was still thinking ""strange, why did that car changed lane?"".

So although Autopilot didn't stop in this situation, I still give it credit for alarming me to take over!

Many are gang members. Some are armed and violent. Most have prior felony convictions. They own cars or are adept at stealing them to commit crimes. They stake out the most lucrative spots for car break-ins such as North Beach, the Palace of Fine Arts, or parking structures like the ones at the Stockton Garage and Costco...
""




...Law enforcement officials estimate that criminal street gangs are behind 70 to 80 percent of auto burglary incidents.5 Public safety officials in both the DA’s Office and SFPD agree on the following about organized criminals:
""




● They are highly proficient at counter surveillance and evading capture.
● They work in teams of two to five people, although different people from the same gang make up the teams on different days. They use mobile phones to communicate with multiple contacts to fence stolen goods.
● Many are known to law enforcement and have multiple felony arrests, some for violent crimes. They switch to other crimes – such as robbery or car theft – if the opportunity arises.
● They operate in target rich areas of the City, such as tourist destinations and large parking structures, and they are extremely active in their crimes. They drive from location to location, breaking into dozens of parked cars in a day, at 30 seconds a break-in, without leaving fingerprints.
● Some are armed, but most avoid violent confrontation because of its attendant risk of being arrested and jailed.
● They are familiar with police tactics and know about the arrests of other gang members through word of mouth and social media.
● Their criminal activity continues as long as it is lucrative and the perceived risk of apprehension is low.

Got delivery today, Was very excited, but i have noticed few problems ones i looked in detail.


Door misaligned, ( i heard they can adjust it)


Stains on the seatback (not sure if this is scratch on oil/water stain, but i tried to wipe it, and won't come off)


Water stain on white seat, seems to be soaked, all tailored lines are yellow on the right compared to the left.
can anyone suggest me what should i do? and what might tesla do?

and to be honest, i have taken delivery of many cars, from honda to porsche, bmw, Tesla's delivery was quickest (have not really explained how to operate anything), and dirtiest (many stains, oil spots, and marks in the car ) i feel they only spend 10 min to clean the car.

Thank you for help

Ah, so it is happening when the system is putting the motor into inefficient mode, to create excess heat to warm the battery. In that case it'll be running more current that can increase sub-audible sounds to the point you can hear them (they overcome the noise-cancelation stuff Tesla has designed, for example), so that makes a lot of sense.

Another possibility is the noise being different is because the running the coolant is being looped differently. There's this 4-way valve that routes the coolant dependent on where the system is trying to move heat from and too.

New to Tesla this year, S85, thrilled with the car, 7k miles in 4 months, now 58k. Plan to keep the car for ?10 years.
Prior owner had NO service done on car, sold it when the 4 year warranty expired.
No problems with car so far.

However, I had feelings of doom and despair this week when came across threads discussing the replacement of eMMC in the MCU1.
This sounds like a HUGE problem - but this was not mentioned in this (or most) threads discussing experience with high-mileage Model S, including resale.
Some posters have stated the Tesla service rep advised them to expect about 50k miles from the MCU!

Do those of you with out of warranty >50k mileage just plan to spend ~$3k every 50 k miles or so to replace the MCU?? Or hope Tesla comes up with a firmware fix (such as reducing dramatically the utilization of the eMMC)?
Is this in actuality a rare problem and not a big deal?
A little concerned about being far from home in adverse weather with family when the MCU does go out - and the expense...
At least one poster also stated there were issues with availability of replacement units and Tesla's willingness to replace them even for $3k.
Look forward to others' input, thanks in advance.
""

This will be a big service deal for Tesla. They had better get their act together in regards to an alternative to $3k per MCU. What you are paying for is a new MCU when all you need is a refurb’d daughter card hosted in the MCU. Tesla should stockpile the bricked MCUs and get a contract in place to refurb the board that has the eMMC chip on it ~ $150-200. Charging $3k to replace the MCU and getting no credit for the core is irresponsible on Tesla’s part.

I just had my MCU changed out for this reason (I believe) on my 2015 P85D at 85,500 miles... under warranty.

And here's a bio on the author; hardly a hack freelance journalist writing a hit piece. [...]
""

I also don't believe this is a ""hit piece"", but I did a little background check on the author on LinkedIn and some website searches. He appears to be a bit of a resume padder. None of the permanent jobs he has held since 1996 have been in self driving cars or AI. He ran his own system integration consulting business for years and has worked as an IT head or CIO for medium sized companies. All his AI and self-driving affiliations seem to be one-man organizations with nothing to show for. He has self-published a couple of books on amazon.com on these topics with hardly any reviews.

While I don't doubt that he is a smart guy and well-read in AI and self-driving topics (probably more so than most of us who are ready to slam the guy), I don't see anything in his body of work that shows that he is a real technical expert on camera vs lidar or that his conclusion of camera+radar vs lidar is based on first-hand expertise.

I think the guy has a good IT background and sees a future in AI and self-driving car technology. He has chosen to make himself appear to be an expert in those areas by writing superficial level articles, books, and a resume, rather than show detailed technical research or work background to backup his claims.

All that said, I still think that us Tesla owners should not be so quick to dismiss these ""running in to stationary objects"" issue and blame it all on the driver. It will be good to understand how Tesla plans to avoid these cases in the near future because many things I hear from Musk make it sound like FSD is imminent and, in the near future, the only reason for the driver to pay attention would be due to regulatory reasons.",,0,0,0,0

The other day my wife and I went to the store. We were on a rural road, wide and well marked. An oncoming car had slowed to a stop or nearly stopped. Then it turned left, crossed our path and entered a driveway. It was far enough away that had it stopped in the middle of my lane I would have had time to stop without using maximum braking force. I let it go without braking at all and I did this pretty much unconsciously. This is what I think my computer (brain) did in this situation:

* Oncoming vehicle detected in left lane ahead, stopped or nearly stopped. Unusual, so dedicate an additional 200,000 neurons to monitor this.
* Vehicle advanced into my lane and is headed straight for me. Path of vehicle is curved and projected path and speed will take it out of a collision threat if it continued. Watch closely.
* Computed time to collision if vehicle stops in my lane is 4.8 seconds. Maximum braking time for full stop to avoid collision is 3.2 seconds. Waited 1 second before applying brakes to see what vehicle does.
* Vehicle continued along its projected curved path, still partially in my lane but now the vehicle cannot stop in my lane due to its forward speed and its reasonable braking power.
* Continued driving without braking.

There was no collision or threat of collision and passenger remained calm. If I was using TACC it would have panicked at the first sign that the oncoming vehicle was in my lane (dumping that bag of groceries in the back seat and prompting a scream into my right ear), regardless if the vehicle was on a path that would take it out of a collision threat within time for my car to brake to a full stop. I'm not saying ""if I can do this why can't Tesla"", but I am puzzled as to why this seems to be so difficult. Tesla does so many other things that require some heavy computin' so why not this? It's got the required information to do so.

Just wondering.
""

That’s why we have a frunk. There is even the little hook thing to keep your groceries upright. That way you can let TACC react like a maniac. I don’t have an answer for the scream in your right ear but if you figure that out please let me know. I get that even without hard braking.",,0,0,0,0

Are you speaking of Lane Departure Avoidance or Emergency Lane Departure Avoidance?

Lane Departure Avoidance nudges the steering wheel to prevent your car from leaving a marked lane. This can be turned off or back to just the older Lane Departure Warning (vibration) in the Controls -> Autopilot menu. I don't think either will activate if your turn signal is on.

Emergency Lane Departure Avoidance will only nudge the steering wheel in response to an imminent side collision. It's accompanied by a red line, red obstacle, and audio alert. It can be turned off for a single drive in the same Controls -> Autopilot menu but will turn itself back on the next time the car is parked.

If LDA is actuating for you all the time, then either turn LDA Off or back to Warning mode. Or start using your turn signals.

If ELDA is actuating for you all the time, then stop driving too close to other cars.


I drove this morning on my normal 25 mile commute to work and didn't have either one ever actuate.
""


Yes, indeed I meant Emergency Lane Departure *Avoidance* (I mistakenly wrote ""assistance"" in my original most). And it's unacceptable. I can say this with confidence after several more days of driving with 16.2 now. The issue is not ""driving too close to other cars"". I drive mostly on country roads, and ELDA nudges the wheel when no other cars are around, but when I go over the line on a shoulder. I should note that for many many curves on my local roads, this is a very natural/normal way to drive. I'm in the US, the lines are pretty normal (double yellow in the middle, white on the shoulders), etc... And this isn't just my opinion - several other people have driven the car and noted this *without* me pointing it out. Apparently ELDA just doesn't handle country roads well. Maybe Elon needs to do some testing on winding New England roads instead of LA traffic once in a while 

For the past 2 days, I've been trying to remember to turn ELDA off every drive, but if you're running a bunch of errands, it's easy to forget when leaving one parking lot or another. And I'd say about half the time I forget, it triggers on a 10-15m drive in a mundane (non-emergency) situation.

a while back, someone opined that the connector on both the antenna amplifier and the radio unit itself (not the one that comes directly off the glass, the other one) looked like a FAKRA connector. i spent a while doing research and eventually found that it seems to be a FAKRA-B (white) connection, as the different FAKRA types are both color coded and lettered. the kicker, though, is that there's a light blue FAKRA-Z connector which is universal and fits all of the other FAKRA connectors.

the other day, i finally found these on amazon:

https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PJX5611

https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PHW5J6C

these are your antenna adapters that fit the connections in the model 3 perfectly and will allow you to connect the FM direct adapter. the catch is that it will only cut the signal completely if you disconnect the other connection to the actual radio unit (the ribbon cable and black connector)...i don't know how those two work together and i don't know that i really care. even with the FM direct adapter in-line using those two adapters above, and the black connector disconnected, it seems to work just the same. i'm still able to use the FM radio if i turn the XM unit off, just as intended. 

i haven't noticed anything different, but i haven't really tested it fully yet other than a real quick drive around the neighborhood...i guess it's possible though that there might be a loss of range or something similar by disconnecting that ribbon cable. i won't be able to fully test it until the 2.5mm extension cable comes in, because like i said the one that is attached to the FM direct adapter isn't nearly long enough. for testing i had it stretched across the middle of the car and that wasn't even long enough to reach where i have the onyx plus mounted...i had to pull it out and put it in the cup holder.",,0,0,0,0

There is probably no way I would use it though. I would probably figure out what gauge / kind of wire it was connected to and install a new receptacle re-using the same wire if it was appropriate. If a dedicated circuit, the idea of switching it to a 240v circuit is a great one.

Thanks for the reply!

I'm an aero-, not electical-engineer, so a little behind the power curve on this (no pun intended). If the wiring is 12-gauge it can handle NEMA 6-20, but if it is 14-gauge I'm limited to NEMA 5-15?
""

If 12 gauge it will support 20a (16a continuous which is what the Tesla needs). If 14 gauge it will support 15a (12a continuous). Either can support 120v or 240v. You will get double the charge speed off the same wire at 240v vs. 120v so it is *highly* recommended. The receptacle types for 240v are 6-15 for 14 awg, 6-20 for 12 awg.",,0,0,0,0

En-Route battery warm up was specifically mentioned in the release notes when I recently updated. 

This early morning I headed to a supercharger with a cold battery power limiter was visible from the start. Through CAN bus data I monitored the battery temperature and battery heater activity the entire time. The battery heater did not turn on the entire drive. 

I plugged in at the supercharger and the power was lower than what I would normally see. Sure enough, the battery heater kicked in shortly after I plugged in. It stayed on until the battery had reached aprox 28 C (82 F). I have seen this behavior many times before, long before the recent software update. When charging at a supercharger and the battery is not warm enough, it will turn on the battery heater to warm up the battery. 

Clearly the battery needed to be warmer for best supercharging speed, yet the car did not warm up the battery on the drive. Only once the car was plugged in did the active heater kick in. Now I'm not saying it doesn't work at all. It most probably works just fine for Model 3 and 100 Model S/X. I assume they just don't bother making changes to the old cars.",,0,0,0,0

3697236,Estimating battery capacity based on Supercharging readout,darth_vad3r,2019-05-27 21:16:00,"I'm not sure if the display on the ""Supercharging"" screen may change based on your display settings similar to the way the normal L1/L2 charging status screen shows km or % and km/hr or kW.

With my display set to ""km"", the Supercharging screen shows me my range at the top middle (same number as that by the battery icon).
Below the car/battery figure it shows: x kW y km/hr +z km

Note that +z km seems to be just a mapping of kWh added converted to a (rated?) km amount, and it does not always equal ""current km range displayed"" minus ""starting km range displayed"". This is probably due to rounding is my guess, but who knows, it could be also due to some non-linear scaling of the displayed km range. I think it may be a bit of both?

e.g. if I started with ""56 km"" range displayed, internally that could be 55.5km to 56.499km. The Supercharging display screen starts at +0km.

During charging I might see 77km range, +21km added ... this matches initial conditions of 56km / +0km.
Then I can see it tick up to +22km but it stays at 77km, fine ... that could be due to rounding. It's gotten to 21.5 or more, but the range is at 76.5 or less. If I started at 55.5km / +0km, then now I could be at 77.0km / +21.5km (aka ""22""). OK, but ... it ticks up again to 78km/+22km ... still fine I guess, could be 77.5km / +22km, and then ... ""79km / +22km"" ... huh? What's happened here?

How can +22km show 77, 78, and 79km range?

IMO, the trip meter and the charge display screen can be ""trusted"" more reliably than the ""range"" indicator as far as trying to extrapolate figures like capacity (whether usable or 0-100% or whatever, not actual physical capacity which nobody but Tesla can know since that includes some brick protection in the bottom 2-3% 5% and some top protection as well most likely since that's what they were doing initially in the Roadster I believe as well, never allowing charge over 95% or 97% or some number).

As far as I'm concerned we're always talking about the number available to us as drivers from ""100%"" displayed and charge stops, down to either ""0%"" or ""car shuts off below 0%"".

... but measuring differences in the displayed range I think throws a monkey wrench into the equation if it adapts non-linearly based on unknown paramters",,0,0,0,0

NOA data:

After navigating a very tricky 43 ramps in 62 different directions section of highway flawlessly, NOA did two new things that impressed the crap out of me.

1. I was in lane two from the left of 6 lanes. Put the signal on to move one lane right. NOA prepared to move, had the blue line and then it suddenly went red, though no ‘cars’ appeared on the screen in neighboring lanes. 

I looked over my right shoulder and there’s a speeding SUV coming across multiple lanes from the right - but still two lanes over and behind me. The SUV hit the lane next to me just as it got beside me. 

I got the distinct impression my car had anticipated this would happen and thus why it held its lane until the SUV passed. In reality it likely picked up a fast moving object coming on a trajectory toward the space it wanted to go - or some such.

2. I was in the right most lane of 4 lanes. A new merge lane was forming to my right with two cars that were going to merge into my lane. There was a very short merge distance. My exit ramp was right after this merge ended. 

The two cars coming on the merge lane were close together. My car and those cars were going to meet at exactly the same time, causing my car to prevent both from being able to merge.

Just as I was about to disengage NOA to take over and yield to those cars, my car slowed enough to create my preset follow distance (7) and let those two cars merge in front of me seamlessly. It was like the car read my mind/knew my driving style.

Gobsmacked.

I was just starting out as an Electronic Engineer when flash memory was first introduced and I did a design with the first generation flash memory. All flash memory has a max write limit per cell. It's always been there. The limit has improved, but it is still there. Constantly write to flash memory and it will eventually fail, no matter the quality.

There was someone who did a stress test of SSD drives writing massive loads to a number of different SSDs until they failed. All lasted past their design limits, but all failed eventually.

The problem that Tesla did was they left the Linux logging turned on, which provides no useful information for service. (The logs service check are written to a removable CD card on the MCU which can be replaced very easily.) This is written to a soldered in flash memory part that eventually fails when the write limit of the chip is reached and then the MCU quits working. Phil Sadow repairs these failures by replacing the chip and turning off the logging.

The latest episode was triggered when TSLAQ shortzes told you ""If Tesla would just do a Cap Raise, then everything will be all right"". You repeated that mantra here for several weeks. Then as soon as the Cap Raise closed, TSLAQ moved on to the next B.S.

Flat spin advanced recovery technique recommended: ​


Lesson Learned: TSLAQ troll's gonna serve up the B.S. dejour to get you to take a bite, then they move on to the next steaming serving of doo-doo. So what to do instead?

IMHO, if you're going to swing trade TSLA, if buying on the way up, you need to be ready to sell on the technicals. Let's look at the Google chart for TSLA from May 7th:

View attachment 412720


The selloff started right at the Opening as TSLA came within $0.60 of the Middle Bollinger Band (the 2nd session in a row that level was tested). See the stockchart from May 7 at 10:10 am: (notice the Middle-BB was $257.87)

View attachment 412721


So when TSLA couldn't hold the Mid-BB, the SP promptly marched down to the Lower-BB, and it has been riding it down ever since, $67 so far. Likely manipulated, but it is what it is, right?

There may be strategies to make money in this setup (I'm no expert on that), but at least let's recognise the signals and turning points for what's going on with the SP.

Personally, with my 7-8 yr investment horizon, I am not playing these games. I choose simply to size my bet appropriately, watch the action and HODL. And also to support the Investor Community, Tesla, and the Mission:

""Our goal when we created Tesla a decade ago was the same as it is today: to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport by bringing compelling mass market electric cars to market as soon as possible.""​
Viewed in these terms, I'd say my Tesla investment is already an amazing feat, and likely to get far better as products and production expand in the mid term. TSLA will take care of itself, Tesla is in no danger of failing. HTH.

Cheers!

Red arrow show direction of travel and circle show how road fork to two. There are 3 lanes, and you need to be in the middle lane for this to happen. 





My initial post is not to be offensive or not to say AP is killing people. I use it too, so it is my life in the life too. I wanted to know if it can go wrong like this. I thought, in this situation, it need to take either left or right, and not to brake. But when this happened to me I felt uncomfortable and bit scared, having heard, one AP driver in CA got into a crash by hitting the middle of a concreate barrier. I wanted to know if this is how AP would work. I am new to using AP, and need to learn how it behave. Two possibilities for me, either my AP is defective or this is how it is and deal with it, that is when I came to the forum. Don't know why some are getting offended. But to me, I am trying to learn out of this to be more aware about how and when to use AP. I need to be more careful when I am on autopilot, especially on new roads. When I start using the same road every day, maybe I will get used to it. But new roads, we need to be extra cautious for us to learn how the NN behave on these conditions. I don't think there is a way to train the NN, instead we need to learn how NN work (Sad). Again point I am trying to make is, car either should have taken left or right without braking and trying to go to the middle. Shouldn't this be taken positive? I am trying to help myself and also others, who need to know its behavior.

What do you mean by ""very small percentage""? Less than 1%, less than 10%, less than 25%? Nobody but Tesla knows the percentages, do you have a source that confirms your claim that it's a ""very small percentage""? We know it's a large enough percentage to justify to Tesla to refuse fixing things like yellow screens (unless the customer pays for it themselves) - if it was just a few cars, Tesla would have replaced the screens without affecting their bottom line. As for fixing cars after accidents, TMC has people post both positive and negative experiences, but it seems negative is higher percentage than positive. Unless you are like Elon or @OBX John and can simply buy a new Tesla every time your current Tesla needs collision repairs, and not worry about any depreciation or sales tax credit you might lose whenever your old one is fixed, you're not likely to experience positive collision repair.

First, navigation is not bad. Tesla's navigation is very good, and way better then any other OEM developed solution.

I recall that the original V9 early release candidates had the ability to add waypoints but that feature did not make it into the final release. I suspect there were some bugs that weren't easy to fix. But the fact that it was there shows Tesla is aware of this feedback so there's hope that they will merge that feature back in the future.

To go into a little more the reason why this happens.

AP does not just use a neural net for image identification (e.g. where the lines are). Tesla has taken the approach of a neural network for the driving decisions as well. This system has minimal, if any future prediction (in current implementation). So it's purely looking at ""am I in the middle of a lane"" because that's how it's been trained (for default AP, NoA is trained to take exits). It does not look ahead to see ""where am I going to be in that splitting lane"" (yet).

Because it's a NN, you can't just introduce behaviors arbitrarily like with fixed code ""do this when the lane splits"". You would have to train the system on what to do with wider lanes. But wider lane behavior is not consistent, nor does Tesla have a frame rate that supports specialized decision making at high speed when lane markers change.

Hopefully these things will be fixed with HW3 training + FPS upgrades, but until then this is not a surprising behavior given how autopilot is created.

↑

IMO, the trip meter and the charge display screen can be ""trusted"" more reliably than the ""range"" indicator as far as trying to extrapolate figures like capacity (whether usable or 0-100% or whatever, not actual physical capacity which nobody but Tesla can know since that includes some brick protection in the bottom 2-3% 5% and some top protection as well most likely since that's what they were doing initially in the Roadster I believe as well, never allowing charge over 95% or 97% or some number).

As far as I'm concerned we're always talking about the number available to us as drivers from ""100%"" displayed and charge stops, down to either ""0%"" or ""car shuts off below 0%"".
""

This (potentially totally outdated because based on original Roadster 18650 cells and chemistry) info is what I was partly remembering and referring to, which said max actual charge allowed was 95% real SOC, and max discharge before shutoff was 2% SOC: A Bit About Batteries

""The other factors affecting cycle life are tied to how the cell is used. In particular:


Avoiding very high and very low states of charge. Voltages over 4.15V/cell (about 95 percent state of charge [SOC]) and voltages below 3.00V/cell (about 2 percent SOC) cause more stress on the insides of the cell (both physical and electrical).
[...]

There is a huge difference in cycle life between a 4.2V/cell charge (defined by the manufacturers as “fully charged”) and a 4.15V/cell charge. 4.15 volts represents a charge of about 95 percent. For this reduction of initial capacity (5 percent), the batteries last a whole lot longer. Unfortunately, further reduction of charge has a much smaller benefit on cycle life. Understanding this tradeoff, Tesla Motors has decided to limit the maximum charge of its cells to 4.15 volts, taking an initial 5 percent range hit to maximize lifetime of the pack. We also limit discharge of our battery pack to 3.0V/cell and will shut down the car when the batteries reach this level.""
​So, again with my above caveats, I'd say a decent guess for current chemistry in the 2170 is something similar-ish to their self-admitted strategy in the Roadster in 2006, and that Tesla's usable capacity from ""displayed 100%"" to ""car shuts off below 0%"" is probably 95% -> 2% actual theoretical SOC).",,0,0,0,0

The car really doesn't know what the ""main"" road is, or should be.
And yes, Y-intersections are the kryptonite for Tesla's AP. At all speeds, and under all circumstances.

Two ways for you to potentially mitigate your situation:
1). Drive under Navigate on AP, which would manifest a preference to bear left or right at that intersection.
2). Drive in the right-most lane, to remove the turn decision from AP's consideration.
3). Drive behind another car, if available. AP will follow and do whatever the leading car is doing.

When the road gets slippery and the cars starts to slide, the natural reaction of every driver is to lift off the accelerator. It is an automatic reaction. It is almost impossible to suppress. In a Tesla, regen kicks in and creates negative torque which can be too much and causing the car to slide even more. Especially on icy roads regen kicking in can make things much worse. I have been in this situation myself and it was scary. Going sideways on a freeway is no fun! Unfortunately neither traction control not stability control acts the same way on regen as it does on acceleration. Traction control will keep my car almost like on rails even in difficult situations when accelerating. But once I let go of the pedal, regen kicks in unfiltered. 

On icy/slippery roads, disabling regen would be the best choice. When the car starts to slide, the best thing you can do to gain stability is to have zero torque on the wheels. Just have them free rolling. Any torque is an additional force that makes the wheel lose grip. To deal with these situations I have literally trained myself to keep on hand on the stalk to switch to neutral quickly. It's the only way to disable regen. Trying to feather the accelerator to be coasting is virtually impossible. The best solution would be for Tesla to have traction control works properly with regen.",,0,0,0,0

Car hits 2 women in Auburn McDonald's parking lot; 1 airlifted



AUBURN, Wash. - Two women were injured - one of them seriously - when they were struck by a car while walking through a McDonald's parking lot in Auburn, police said.

Officers and medics responded to the scene, in the 1400 block of Lake Tapps Parkway SE, at around 7 p.m. Thursday after receiving reports of a car-pedestrian accident, said Cmdr. Steve Stocker of the Auburn police.

The vehicle hit the women at low speed, but one of them fell after being struck and hit her head against the pavement. She was airlifted to Harborview Medical Center in Seattle in serious condition.

The other woman sustained a minor injury and was taken to Auburn Hospital. Both women are in their 40s.

The driver told police that he did not see the two women, possibly due to the sun in his eyes. He remained at the scene after the accident and cooperated with the investigation. There is no evidence that he was impaired, Stocker said.

This was actually bought from Tesla (had to go down to Houston from Dallas to pick it up at their location there), with regular title. I was worried a bit about the flood of flood-damaged cars down there, but I don't think this was likely in this case. I didn't think to ask about access to Supercharging. They mentioned it was available, asked how I planned to charge (since I'm about to move in several weeks, currently just using 110V at home, and Supercharger when available/needed), and didn't mention any upcoming or current need to pay for use of Superchargers. And used 2 on drive back from Houston to Dallas. Thinking I should have clarified more here with them, but maybe it's standard to continue access with cars bought from Tesla?

I presume you haven't owned a BMW, Mercedes, Audi or Range Rover??

Lexus apart, I've yet to find a 'premium' brand that can beat even Nissan/Nissan interms of reliability or just having a car that works with no issues. My last BMW was at the shop so often they kept the spare key!! I see BMW finished in last place in the most recent JD Power user survey, yet people still buy them? Why is that?

Lets be honest here everyone pretends they want a trouble free 'perfect' life, but if you look at how our minds actually work been human beings mean we thrive off drama, its why news paper headlines of good news rarely sell like the ones reporting doom/gloom, its also why true 'happiness' has virtually no correlation to productivity, quite the opposite in fact at the extreme ends of the scale. In cars people want new stuff, interesting stuff, and for many thats far more important than ultimate reliability.

If you want a simple and guaranteed trouble free life buy a Nissan Leaf, its cheaper and works fine. But if you want something that makes you smile no car comes close to a Tesla.

...This is precisely the scenario AP2 identifies well in advance and reduces the speed even before the car in front of you switched lanes...
""

True. I've seen my Autopilot has been able to display 2 cars in front on the instrument cluster. A visible one from immediate front and the one that's hidden from front view.

That's how Autopilot could apply brakes even before the second car in front becomes visible.

But not in this case. It displayed one car in front at a time: It had the ability to label the moving-out-of-lane car as red then it transferred that red color to the now visible stopped car in front.

The system did react before I applied the brakes. You could see the two teal icon still lit up but the speed of the car slowed down from 61 to 53 MPH and that's when I heard the alarm and overrode the system and the Autopilot icons were then turned off at 53 MPH.

Usually, Autopilot would just stopped my car for stopped traffic in front of me quietly and it has never alarmed before.

So why did it alarm this time? It's possible the Autopilot did not slow the car enough and the Collision Warning had to independently alert me.

I think the 61 MPH (which is too fast) might be a factor in this case for Autopilot and thus, the alarm for driver's help.",,0,0,0,0

The TL;DR version:

I'm in Vancouver.


Was sent to pick-up location on the wrong day

Was given the incorrect total for a bank draft

Picked up SR+ 3/30 after having been convinced it would be well worth paying the difference between it and the SR due to the SR having manual seats, mirrors, cloth seats, no centre console or USB, 32km less range, no heated seats, no fog lights, no live traffic data or sat maps.(All lies apart from the last point, which the SR+ has never had anyway).

Car was not inspected

Car was dirty (did not see it until way after paying and completing insurance due to the zoo it was that day)

Also, after quadruple and triple checking if they would ever be eligible for the upcoming federal rebate I was told: absolutely not

Paid >~$59,300 which included paying $4000 for AP, after provincial rebate. Bumped into luxury tax of 14% for basic black/black SR+

Days later they integrated AP and lowered the price such that there would be no luxury tax

Then they started releasing the SR as the SR+, the SR having never existed, for a much lower price


They didn't apply referral until after maybe 20 emails/calls, then I received 1500km. A couple of days after it was changed to 7500km.
(They have yet to honour their statement that owners lied to about the SR would be able to 'downgrade' to it)
30 days after purchase they suddenly release a compliance car, priced under the federal cutoff

The SR/SR+ scam worked out to costing me just under $5000. That includes the price difference and tax difference.

The federal rebate 30 days after I bought my car cost me about $7000.

Hope that makes some of you feel less ripped off by the every-lying and dishonourable Tesla.

They fail to respond to 90% of communication attempts, and when they do it's with misinformation, or passing-the-buck.

The car is amazing. It really is. But I cancelled my order for PY and have to think long and hard about dealing with Tesla again. I still recommend the Model 3 SR+ as it's the safest car, doesn't pollute, drives well etc., but if there was a different company with a superior product I'd go to them instead. At this time I'm considering the Rivian R1S, since the 3 was a temporary car for me. I'm glad I got to see how Tesla really is.

Of note, I'm a shareholder, and Tesla evangelist since 2006. This was a rough knock to say the least.

Anyway, there's the short version of my story.

4/27 Finale
Showed up at the delivery center at 1615 and decided to just hang out till the car was ready. Met the manager and one of the orientation guys and talked. Both mentioned how impressed they were with the condition of the car.

Around 1730 I saw them pull
Our car into the delivery bay and things started getting exciting. Around 1750 they pulled it outside and they came and got us. The car looked awesome and a top to bottom inspection only turned up 2 small things that weren’t in pictures. Overall the car was immaculate and even smelled clean (neutral not flower scents). Spent about 40 minutes going through our checklist, got 2 fobs and a gen 1 umc. Threw my wife in and let her drive us out of Austin. We traded about halfway and I couldn’t be more impressed with the entire car. Autopilot is awesome and the range was incredible. Started at 80 percent and got home at 20.

I’ll post more pictures tomorrow but here is the only one I got before we started home. Thanks everyone for the support to help get us here. It was definitely worth the trials lol.

Thanks for posting that Brando. That was an interesting presentation.

Elon has done some amazing things with Tesla as a car company and I think Tony Seba pointed that out pretty well. It is also apparent that he thinks that Waymo is way ahead with the self driving technology.

I don't know anything about Lidar or Waymo, but I will say that the FSD option on my model 3 has so far been a disappointment. Maybe Tony is correct on this one. What do you think ?
""

Elon has it nailed.

Lidar uses photons (light even if ""laser""). Not much different than regular light.
""image recognition and what to do"" you solve for visual light, then you must solve for Lidar (twice the work).
IF the two different sensors don't agree - what do you do? So added complexity, seldom a good thing.

Extreme case you could use Radar, Lidar, camera and sonar when they don't all agree, what do you do?
Very complex to blend all these different views of the world and then decide what to do. 
As Elon says, finding driveable space is the goal. GPS or Maps can't handle construction or broken down cars so not much help.
Watch this video - long & detailed - rewind often to understand. Totally worth the effort. look up words you don't understand.


Certainly not an easy problem. Big Data is key for Machine Learning - no one has anywhere near the data Tesla has gathered.
Elon always the optimist - and his time lines aggressive - when? your guess as good as mine. Elon's better. 2 years? seems certainly 5 years?
RoboTaxi? a new problem - how many ""regulations"" do you see a taxi break just picking up/dropping off passengers? Ask Lyft/Uber drivers.
illegal/double parking - stopping in the road ...

You are seeing better than most, how much work needs to be done. REMEMBER still a work in progress. Best to perhaps think of it as a co-pilot to ""help"" you drive - reminder texting drivers worse than drunk drivers and cause about 8-10,000 extra deaths each years since 2014 - far from RoboTaxi at this point, right? 

Sorry, I don't remember Tony's timeline. He is awfully good, but it is hard to predict, especially the future of things never seen/done before.
Interesting times. Never thought I'd see coffee shops or brewers in SLC. How about a winery and grape growing is that started yet?
And is Provo still caffeine and alcohol free?? I miss Utah Coal and Lumber in Park City. If you ever get chance to go to film festival that was worth doing. I enjoyed it.

I don't work for one of the 3 big tech companies mentioned above, but I was under the impression that they have a lot of free workplace charging stations.
""

If by ""free"", you mean no-cost, then you are correct. If by ""free"" you mean ""available to use consistently,"" you would be wrong. Bear in mind that one round trip to Santa Cruz would require tying up a L2 charger (at ~14 miles per hour) for literally the entire day and then some.

L2 charging is nearly useless for people making that trip unless your employer has one charging stall per car that needs charging.

We actually had a thread at work where I did the math for folks with long-range commutes, and by my math, because the workplace charging is likely to happen at the bottom of the battery, it replaces the fastest part of your supercharging, which means that if it takes you ten minutes to walk down to the garage to plug in your car in the middle of the day, you have to charge for something like five or six hours before you make up that ten minutes at the end of the day in supercharger savings.

Basically, workplace L2 charging only works for locals, not long-range commuters. For long-range commuters, if you don't have a dedicated L2 charger that is yours and yours alone, you'll end up supercharging constantly.

Secondly, because they don't account for getting the short end of the stick when forced to plug in second on a paired supercharger, which is something that will routinely happen when charging at busy superchargers on the way to or home from work or during lunch hours (i.e. when everyone else is trying to do the exact same thing).

↑

You are way over-thinking this. Your home electrical panel and the Tesla were designed by experts that have considered these conditions and already have built-in protection.

Your modern 200A panel is designed so that if the total loads exceed 200A, your main breaker will trip. If you find that happening (meaning you have exceeded all the current that your home can safely handle), then you can start dialing down the Tesla charge rate. So just charge at your convenience: your panel will protect you from unsafe scenarios. There are some older split bus panels that do not have a main breaker: most electricians will strongly advise folks to replace those style panels. But you said your house is new and split bus panels were eliminated decades ago.

Regarding whether to run the Wall Charger at full bore, just rely on the considerable thoughtful engineering that Tesla has performed. Plug it in, set the max charge to 80%, and forget about it. There is a complicated relationship between rate of charge and frequency of charge that affects the life of your battery. All of us yahoos on the Internet (myself included, and I'm an electrical engineer that installs battery-based systems) are not privy to the mountains of research and development, and the complexity, that have gone into the Tesla battery design. I believe it is fair to say that Tesla knows more about battery designs, and battery management controllers, than anyone in the world. I think its safer to rely on Tesla than the google-informed (or worse) opinions about electrical operation you'll get from the Internet.
""

FWIW, you should never rely on your main breaker tripping due to an overload. Your primarily line of defense is “load calculations” which ensure you don’t hook too much to your electrical system. The breaker is just a backup and should not be relied on. They sometimes fail to operate.

The same holds true for a split bus panel but even moreso since there is no main breaker.

I do agree that you can just charge your Tesla at the max rate your EVSE can supply and not worry about it. My M3 LR charges at 48a daily. The charge rate is so vastly below the supercharging rate that I don’t worry about the batteries. It could be harder on the electronics though since it is running them at their design spec limits.

Strength product design.
Weakness- terrible manager, can't plan anything, does not understand the customer and the value of money, lack of ethics, emotional, likes to play the victim, stubborn and gets stuck on irrational decisions, does not try to learn, to improve.

Everything Tesla has been doing for the past year with their focus on current quarter has halved demand. It's on them, not on anyone else.
They should have delivered all Model 3 versions in all markets from day one, they should not play with prices, should add a HUD, redesign the door handles, add more options, offer reasonable leasing terms and FSD prices, fix the quality control and service issues.. Take the lower margins to begin with and go up from there, the stock would be at 500-600$ now. Provide proper outlook every quarter with revenue and non-GAAP EPS being mandatory, don't leave room for speculation, educate the press about EVs and Tesla.
Musk just tanked the stock with a pointless comment, he has to be a drama queen all the time, if we lose money like in Q1 , the cash runs out in 10 months, like the press is not gonna forget about the IF. He also seems to confuse GAAP net income and cash flow but that's another matter. And he keeps making pointless or plain untrue statements that hurt Tesla, just because he likes to whine. He's digging his own hole and blaming others.

Instead of working on demand for M3 and MY, Musk got stuck on getting the most out of current quarter , no matter how damaging in the long term. Reservations run out in Q2, second half of the year could be quite problematic since Tesla cut demand in half with all their recent actions. They are not doing anything right anymore.

Excellent post on Elon's weakness and a few critical thoughts - focusing on current quarter has halved demand, should have delivered M3s to all markets from the get-go, ....

Strength: vision, hard-working, incredible drive to achieve goals, ability to dive in and fix problems
Weakness: inability to execute orderly; urge to take an action without reasoning through implications; stubborn - not taking advice; hubris and irrational decisions; management skills.

The core of problems is that Tesla doesn't execute orderly, which is the result of inability to plan with details and managing the risks on what could go wrong. Without a good planning, the project is mostly off as something ""unexpected"" always occur.
It's crazy and damaging that Tesla keep changing prices to stimulate immediate demands at the expense of future demands as buyers are deterred on possible future price drop. There seems no one there to argue with Elon on common sense. Elon is probably making decisions on his own, and that has contributed to one bad decision after another. Take the robotaxi as an example - 1. Switching the future of Tesla to robotaxi at the time the company is dealing with productions and demands. 2. Making a presentation from engineering perspective to financial people. 3. Announcing robotaxi and autonomous driving available next year with an autonomous driving demo showing skills so far below an average driver.
The irrational decisions are costly. Those decisions were not run through logical seasonings, let alone ""first principle"".The falcon wing door that set back model X at least 2 years; The decision to go self-finance that has delayed productions of semi, model Y, truck, GF 4 and 5, just when the competitions are investing heavily. The worst one is the model 3 production - insisting on excess automation and taking out integration and testing time in rolling out the production lines. The two decisions sealed the fate of model 3 production hell, and forced Doug Field to leave the company.",,0,0,1,0

With the exception of the Broadway Sydney and Richmond Melbourne Superchargers, you will often be the only Tesla at a Supercharger. This may change from Christmas this year when we are joined by a bunch of Model 3 owners but it will be a few years before there will be congestion even on high traffic days like Boxing Day.
For the Bathurst trip, There is now an NRMA CHAdeMO charger in Bathurst, but you will need an adapter.
""

I'd also add - rather than buy the the CHAdeMO adapter - try and get the upcoming CCS Combo 2 (CCS2) adapter (and required car charging circuit upgrade) from Tesla.

The NRMA chargers support both and CCS2 can support a higher charge rate, although the NRMA uses the Veefil-RT which is limited to 50kW. 

Not sure if NRMA will start rolling out the Veefil-PK which can do up to 350kW.

Actually the ideal case is to have the side camera casing which suits for all versions of vehicle (S/X) from AP0 to AP3, this is why I came up the idea to use the 360 side camera casing (mounted under the side camera).
I have actually considered to custom make a repeater camera casing (with the AHD camera) for AP0 and AP1 vehicle, but as a result that the AP2+ vehicle cannot benefit from it.

For AP2.0 : If making the decoder board for repeater camera, the CMOS sensor is preset as CCCR output, which makes the image to be monochrome and red only. Also the cost of the decoder board is high

That is correct. Just like the range indication is a direct conversion from battery level, the mi/hr charging indication is now a direct conversion from charge power. These are the conversion factors I've noted:

3P: 4.09 mi/hr / kW
3LR RWD: 4.27 mi/hr / kW
3SR+: 4.56 mi/hr / kW
""

My 3 SR+ numbers posted in my other thread (Estimating battery capacity based on Supercharging readout) match fairly closely with yours for the 3 SR+ above.

In your units of mi/hr / kW my number would be 4.57 though (4.5662, and I'd also like to point out that mi/hr / kW reduces to mi/kWh )

I was measuring in terms of consumption, not efficiency, so Wh/km (or Wh/mi). I got a bounded range of 136.000 to 136.187 Wh/km, which I noted the mid-point as being very close to exactly 219.000 Wh/mi (136.08 Wh/km).

219 Wh/mi is the same as 4.5662 mi/kWh

If I remove any assumption about it being a 'round' number 219.0, then the bounded range I determined maps to:
4.5626 - 4.5689 mi/kWh (midpoint is 4.5658 mi/kWh which still rounds up to 4.57).

In any case, we're very close here 

Taking your 4.09 and 4.27 numbers, I get 3P: 244.5 Wh/mi and 3LR RWD: 234.2 Wh/mi",,0,0,0,0

We are talking about trip km * trip Wh/km = trip Wh, then Wh/rkm (rkm being 'rated km' the number we think is 'rated' anyways that's shown on the display gauge), right?

For this data to be accurate I'd want to have snapshotted the start/end rated/displayed km/mi/% immediately before/after the 'trip' info is recorded and not include any intervening time spent in Park. Unfortunately, even some of my commutes have that due to stops at a drive-thru and pause to eat, LOL
""


Yes that is the formula. The opportunity to be able to measure it accurately for myself is pretty rare. You clearly understand the various pitfalls (like time spent in park). One other thing is to do a pre-drive before doing the measurement - because a cold battery could throw off the delta in rkm. But that is not too hard - you can actually reset the trip meter right as a rated km “rolls over”, after a few miles of warmup (maybe quite a few if it is chilly), and if you keep an eye on the rated km as you are nearly finished with the drive, you can actually get rid of some of the rounding errors on the rated km display and get part of an additional digit of precision on that part. (Because you’ll know approximately how close you are to rolling over to the next rated km.). Another final caveat is to put the car in park to finalize the measurement results in the trip meter (it does not continuously update but putting it in park forces the final numbers to be displayed).

Granted, yesterday's traffic was the lightest yet (only 44 NOA events, 59% of average), which as previously noted, could indicate a correlation (see third plot below).

In other notes, I believe there is a new steering oscillation which is hard to pinpoint, with a period of maybe 3-4 seconds.

I see improvements mentioned (FM direct tune, nav from phone, ignore toll roads and HOV lanes, speed limiter). This is certainly more than nothing. Also, I see a fair amount of ""I hate the new UI"" which you get no matter how you change the UI. Some people see to like the addition of games. The early bugs seem to have gotten fixed, and the camera on top issue resolved to most people's satisfaction. Also, some newer improvements seem to have gone in as well. I'm afraid I'm not seeing that V9 was a downgrade.

In any case, the complaint I responded to was just ""some feature changed in V9 and that sucks"", not MC1/AP1 was impacted in a particularly bad way. So I don't see that I needed to go research something irrelevant in order to respond.
""

You might not think browser not working anymore is impacting in a particularly bad way, some people do. Having to look all the way down of the screen while driving to perform functions previously available on top, and now not only way farther from the regular line of sight, but also buried under more levels of slower menus, again maybe a personal issue. So, personally, I used to use my browser, so v9 seems like a downgrade. I almost got into an accident while trying to peck at the tiny buttons on the bottom the screen in the right sequence in order to bring up the phone app, and then had to keep looking down because the phone app is also now only available at the bottom. Using the phone app is supposed to be safer than using the phone, well, not in a Tesla. Maybe those are not bad things to you, the way you use your car. If you don't use the browser you wouldn't miss it. I don't have pano, and it's no longer offered, so if all pano controls were to disappear from the next version, I wouldn't miss it, but I bet some people might. 

V9 complaints are more than just about change. Every time software changed (I've been using it since v6), yes some people were not so crazy about it, but complaints dissipated fairly quick. I remember each time the new release came, I though, yea, this is worse but this other thing is better, and fairly quickly I would get used to the new software. I've had v9 for months now, still hate it every time I drive, even if for nothing else but to have to keep hiding the flippin media player which keeps popping up at every occasion, or whenever I try to use the browser, or raise suspension, or make a phone call.",,0,0,0,0

Maar op laadpalen in landen buiten de Benelux vertrouw ik eigenlijk nooit.

@Electroman your recognized 121 / 114 split is not where this happened to me (You did not recognize the location correctly). Anyone local can confirm this behavior. You need to travel on 121 south bound on local road with AP on and see what happens. GPS location is here. (33°03'10.4""N 96°55'05.9""W - find it on Google Maps). Red arrow show direction of travel and circle show how road fork to two. There are 3 lanes, and you need to be in the middle lane for this to happen.


View attachment 412771


My initial post is not to be offensive or not to say AP is killing people. I use it too, so it is my life in the life too. I wanted to know if it can go wrong like this. I thought, in this situation, it need to take either left or right, and not to brake. But when this happened to me I felt uncomfortable and bit scared, having heard, one AP driver in CA got into a crash by hitting the middle of a concreate barrier. I wanted to know if this is how AP would work. I am new to using AP, and need to learn how it behave. Two possibilities for me, either my AP is defective or this is how it is and deal with it, that is when I came to the forum. Don't know why some are getting offended. But to me, I am trying to learn out of this to be more aware about how and when to use AP. I need to be more careful when I am on autopilot, especially on new roads. When I start using the same road every day, maybe I will get used to it. But new roads, we need to be extra cautious for us to learn how the NN behave on these conditions. I don't think there is a way to train the NN, instead we need to learn how NN work (Sad). Again point I am trying to make is, car either should have taken left or right without braking and trying to go to the middle. Shouldn't this be taken positive? I am trying to help myself and also others, who need to know its behavior.


Appreciate for the comments.

This is within the feeder lane where you take either 121 or 121 Business split which comes at an odd angle, where without the NoA the car doesn't know which one leads to 121 highway.

3697819,Does this set the stage for Tesla to sell a refreshed Model S at a higher price?,bob_p,2019-05-28 06:38:00,"EVs are more expensive than ICEs - especially without government subsidies.

Model S/X have always been relatively more expensive than comparably equipped luxury ICEs (when you ignore the difference between owning an ICE and an EV).

For many S/X owners, their purchase was (by far) the most expensive vehicle they've ever bought - and it's likely a high percentage of those customers would have strongly considered 3/Y, if available.

Will we see a refresh of S/X? Yes. This could be driven by FSD - if/when Tesla gets approval for unassisted self driving, the driver's ""cockpit"" will not be as important, and we could see vehicles without a steering wheel, or with an alternative that would allow the steering wheel to have less impact. And we're likely to see increased emphasis on all passengers (including the person sitting in the ""driver seat""), items such as workspaces, hotspots, entertainment systems (video!), rotating front seats, … Since Tesla (Musk) strongly believes this will happen in the next few years, it seems highly unlikely we'll see major interior changes until FSD is close to ready.

Will we see other smaller changes to S/X? Yes. Tesla (Musk) has announced a new battery pack will be coming out next year, which will fully support V3 supercharging and extend pack life from 300-400K miles to 1M miles. We're also likely to see smaller interior/exterior changes - if the changes can either have high impact or help reduce manufacturing cost.

Even with other manufacturers introducing competing EVs, Tesla is still the market leader, because of their head start on battery, motor and charging technologies & deployment. In the near term, especially with the disappearing US tax credit, the biggest impact for Tesla will come in cost reductions and bringing the S/X purchase price down while maintaining profitability, and positioning Tesla to defend their S/X sales.

The current mapping system is very bad. 

I have had two instances where the route to the destination was wrong. The first one took me up a dirt road and told me to make a left turn where there was no road, just a fence. I was a mile past where I should have turned. This was out in the country, where cell signals are spotty, in central Virginia.

The second one almost got me to the destination. It turned one road too soon and stopped in the middle of a turn ramp. This was in an area, in PA, that has been developed for at least 100 years and there is no problem with cell signals.

If you have never been to your destination before, allow at least an extra hour to get there.

I get that open source is cheaper than Garmin. However if it doesn't work it is useless.

I complained about the first one to Tesla and they sent me a thank you for helping to update the open source map. If they are depending on people who get misdirected to update the open source map it will take 50 years to get it right.

Leaving Garmin for open source was, IMHO, a stupid decision.

3697858,Home charging versus supercharging,bob_p,2019-05-28 06:56:00,"For Supercharging, Tesla has suffered from their minimalist philosophy of specifying terms and conditions for purchase and use of the vehicles.

Originally supercharging was marketed as free unlimited long distance charging on the supercharger network. But they never included any T&C's with vehicle purchase or when vehicles were connected to the superchargers. Over time, this evolved into FUSC (Free Unlimited Supercharging), which included not only the originally intended long distance charging, but also support for urban charging for those owners who live somewhere without access to overnight charging.

If you have a FUSC vehicle, while technically you could do all of your charging at a supercharger, you'll find that experience to consume considerably more time than periodically refueling an ICE. Urban superchargers tend to be busier and more likely to have waits for charging (especially as the number of Model 3's explodes). You'll spend the time to drive to the supercharger, plus the charging time and the wait - which could mean spending an hour or two after every 200 miles of driving...

Home charging is much better because you recharge overnight - and don't have to spend time going to a charger.

You'll need power for your home charging. This is usually a 14-30 (30A) or 14-50 (50A) outlet, which should provided enough power to recharge overnight. You can use the UMC that comes with the car (you may need to purchase an adapter for the specific outlet), if you plan to keep the UMC plugged in most of the time (since you should try to avoid plugging/unplugging the 14-30/14-50 outlet frequently).

Tesla sells a CMC (Corded Mobile Connector) with a 14-50 plug for a 50A outlet, which you can keep plugged in all of the time at home, and carry the UMC with you for emergencies.

Or you can purchase a Wall Connector (used to be called High Power Wall Connector) which is permanently mounted and can be directly connected to power. If you can get a 60A circuit, that provides enough power (48A) for maximum charging for most new Tesla vehicles.",,0,0,0,0

For a lightly dirty car, from my experience, ONR is safe and does not induce scratches. 

However, a huge factor is how you dry the car and what you dry it with. I have considered using an air blower as it would mean no actual touching of the paint. However, I would be concerned that over time, after multiple washes and blasts of air, certain components of the car would suffer some wear and tear, such as some delicate sensors. Also, I would imagine that using an air blower would not only dry the car but is likely to cause dust from the ground below the car to be thrown into the air, raining dust down on your freshly washed car.

So instead I use very plush microfiber towels and a drying aid such as AMMO NYC Hydrate that lets you dry the car using a wet towel. Larry, the founder of AMMO NYC, has videos on youtube that are very informative on this subject.

One last factor to keep in mind is that microfiber towels do require some special handling to avoid inducing scratches with them. You should NEVER use fabric softener when washing microfiber towels and you should never dry them on a heat setting above ""ultra low"" in the dryer. And once the towels start to feel like they are losing their softness, I throw them away and buy new ones.",,0,0,0,0

↑

EVs are more expensive than ICEs - especially without government subsidies.

Model S/X have always been relatively more expensive than comparably equipped luxury ICEs (when you ignore the difference between owning an ICE and an EV).

For many S/X owners, their purchase was (by far) the most expensive vehicle they've ever bought - and it's likely a high percentage of those customers would have strongly considered 3/Y, if available.

Will we see a refresh of S/X? Yes. This could be driven by FSD - if/when Tesla gets approval for unassisted self driving, the driver's ""cockpit"" will not be as important, and we could see vehicles without a steering wheel, or with an alternative that would allow the steering wheel to have less impact. And we're likely to see increased emphasis on all passengers (including the person sitting in the ""driver seat""), items such as workspaces, hotspots, entertainment systems (video!), rotating front seats, … Since Tesla (Musk) strongly believes this will happen in the next few years, it seems highly unlikely we'll see major interior changes until FSD is close to ready.

Will we see other smaller changes to S/X? Yes. Tesla (Musk) has announced a new battery pack will be coming out next year, which will fully support V3 supercharging and extend pack life from 300-400K miles to 1M miles. We're also likely to see smaller interior/exterior changes - if the changes can either have high impact or help reduce manufacturing cost.

Even with other manufacturers introducing competing EVs, Tesla is still the market leader, because of their head start on battery, motor and charging technologies & deployment. In the near term, especially with the disappearing US tax credit, the biggest impact for Tesla will come in cost reductions and bringing the S/X purchase price down while maintaining profitability, and positioning Tesla to defend their S/X sales.

Doubt this is setting the stage for Tesla to increase prices and create an even larger gap between 3/Y and S/X...

Is there not a direct relationship between power and torque?

Yes, the speed. Torque is rotational force. Force is mass times acceleration, F = M • A. Work or energy is force times distance. Power is the rate of work, so force times distance divided by time or force times speed. 

So the two are directly related by the RPM or the speed of the car, however you prefer to look at it in these cars with one gear.

My wife tried desperately to stop the Tesla with the brakes and emergency brake. She was helpless as the car was uncontrollable and would not respond to her actions......
""

Hi,

Sorry to hear about the accident, at-least it's good that no one got seriously hurt.

I have been driving the Model-3 past almost ten months now & never ever had I (or the wife) felt that it has a mind of its own while accelerating or braking, it really 'obeys' us the drivers at all times, yes it does give a ton of dinging alarms if it feel you are going to crash into a vehicle.

Reading those first few lines in your comments, here's what I understand that your wife was stopped at a traffic light, even if the car had started to drive ""on it's own"", it still would have stopped when it touched the car in front, no matter what.
What must have happened (which it usually does), your wife must have (in panic) hit the accelerator pedal instead of brake, a ""Human Error"" - end of story.

A few years back we all read stories how some Toyota Prius drivers claimed their car's brakes were locked and the car just sped into the vehicles in front of them, there was even one driver who had claimed that his car's brakes wouldn't engage as he was barrelling down on some Interstate.",,0,0,0,0

↑

I am very comfortable with it. But that being said, I am a tech enthusiast and use it responsibly - I understand its limitations and functions fully and as a result know when and when not to use it. I never take my eyes off the road while it's engaged and I don't use it in high risk areas (like construction areas).

I have already put 700 miles on my LR AWD Model 3 since getting it 11 days ago and 80% of that driving has been on Autopilot. In that time it's braked for no reason and approached the edge of its lane while taking a curve. The system is very well done but there is still much more work to be done before it's perfect. It still cannot act as a human would in certain situations.
""

This pretty much sums up my thoughts as well.

We took a small road trip this weekend with the family (me, wife, 6 year old son, 3 year old daughter, and 2 year old daughter) and I used Autopilot and NOA for 75%+ of the trip. 

I've had the car since 4/26 and have about 1,000 miles on it. I've spent a significant amount of those miles testing out autopilot (I'm also a tech enthusiast and this was a big reason I bought the car) so I have a good understanding of when it performs well and when it's going to struggle and I intervene as necessary and always keep my hands on the wheel and my eyes on the road.

This weekend the GPS went crazy on me (posted in another thread with video examples) and that apparently caused some odd autopilot behavior while on the interstate. This is probably the worst thing I've had happen in my time with the car. And even with this glitch I'm very comfortable with autopilot.

My wife has been in a rather traumatic car accident recently and is still very jumpy in cars. Someone T-boned her doing 60+mph and flipped her Audi Q7 with all three kids in the car. Luckily the worst injury was that my middle daughter broke both bones in her left arm. Everyone else was completely unharmed... except the mental trauma that my wife still deals with. Anyway - the reason I say this is to make a point that my wife actually LOVES the M3 autopilot. Sure, sometimes it scares her just like any other human driver would but she takes comfort in the fact that there is a bit of redundancy (autopilot and human oversight) and she loves that I can set the speed limit and just let the car do its thing. If I'm doing the driving then I'll likely go faster than the car on autopilot so she likes the more laid back feeling of autopilot.

On a side note - I know I'm not the first to report this but I AM pleased to say that the M3 comfortably fits 3 car seats. We use Diono Radian car seats and they are fairly narrow (and very safe/substantial - it's the same brand/model that the kids were using in the accident so I'll forever trust them) so if anyone is looking for good, safe car seats that fit 3 across in the M3, these work great.",,0,0,0,0

It's just going to get worse for the Model Y. There is some logic in the widespread practice of putting a window panel below the lip of the spoiler edge (Prius started it, continued by Insight, Volt, and others). We can't have it both ways: aerodynamics and visibility without appearance compromises. 

My personal enthusiasm is for a convertible or at least a targa top, which Tesla seems to favor to judge by their Roadster 1, 2, and 3. But that is a big compromise over the complete folding down of the roof for a true convertible. Check out the two versions of the Mazda Miata, one with soft top that fold down in 3 seconds without motor assist, and other a ""retracting fastback"", that really is a retracting targa top.

3697936,Can you use Optimum No Rinse Wash & Shine followed up with a Ceramic Wax product?,Daniellane,2019-05-28 07:34:00,"joebruin77 said:
↑

In my experience, doing a rinseless wash with ONR does not induce scratches unless it is used on an extremely dirty car that should only be cleaned with a tradional car wash using lots of water and soap. For a lightly dirty car, from my experience, ONR is safe and does not induce scratches. 

However, a huge factor is how you dry the car and what you dry it with. I have considered using an air blower as it would mean no actual touching of the paint. However, I would be concerned that over time, after multiple washes and blasts of air, certain components of the car would suffer some wear and tear, such as some delicate sensors. Also, I would imagine that using an air blower would not only dry the car but is likely to cause dust from the ground below the car to be thrown into the air, raining dust down on your freshly washed car.

So instead I use very plush microfiber towels and a drying aid such as AMMO NYC Hydrate that lets you dry the car using a wet towel. Larry, the founder of AMMO NYC, has videos on youtube that are very informative on this subject.

One last factor to keep in mind is that microfiber towels do require some special handling to avoid inducing scratches with them. You should NEVER use fabric softener when washing microfiber towels and you should never dry them on a heat setting above ""ultra low"" in the dryer. And once the towels start to feel like they are losing their softness, I throw them away and buy new ones.
""

I agree, I use deionized water and the Master Blaster Revolution Dryer. (See video linked in post # 29) No towel drying anymore ever. It will transform the slightest miss of soil removal into a sand paper. When using a blower, you will occasionally see missed spots (usually in the concave sections above the rocker panels) Because I live in the North West, there are almost always some levels of heavier soil from the roads.

I took delivery of white/white SR yesterday. I showed up with my tape measure and flashlight. When the advisor greeted me with his paperwork I let him know I’m going to need about 45 minutes to complete my checklist and invited him to go do something else until I was ready. There were two of us there going through every inch of the car, even crawling underneath it to check for scratches. We looked for swirl marks, scratches, panel gap variations, headlight alignment, interior fit and finish...everything we could possibly go through.

In the end, I was able to find a small wrinkle in the white leather on the passenger seat. And I was almost embarrassed to point it out but I figured after 45 minutes I’ve got to come up with something. So he took it back tot he service center, applied some steam to it, and brought the car back out ten minutes later, wrinkle free.

I’m sure not every car is like this, but this car really was as perfect as I could expect. Anything else I could have pointed out would have just been silly.

No need to make a smaller pack version (which would also cut range), Tesla can instead add a super-chill mode, or you run in valet or teen driver mode to reduce max performance.
The majority of the cost is in the low volume production and development (and halo). Dropping to a 100kWh pack would only shave ~ 12k off the price (ignoring R&D). Even dropping the front motor and creating a new single motor rear drive unit would not get you $50k off.

That's kind of not the point, even though that's how it was framed, it's about cost. The point is that the Roadster as a car category is quite attractive, just look at something like the Mazda Miata which sells by the bucket load, despite its lack of power. Porsche Cayman is another beautiful example. I can imagine a, EV Roadster would handle beautifully with no rear (or front) engine and a low center of gravity. But $250k is a lot of cash. A smaller battery and less insane specs could be done for a lot less money and attract mid-life crisis types who want to look cool and beat most cars around the canyon, but don't need sub 2-second launch times.

TBH I think Tesla will definitely launch a sub $100k Roadster eventually. A RWD one with a 75Kw battery could be hugely entertaining.

I'm going to investigate this - I've seen some car wash products that mix solution in the water sprayed on the car - maybe that would do it. Might have to spray twice a year to get it to keep up with the dirt. But I hope this works.

But to answer your question - yes physical contact with a mop is the only thing that will get the dirt off that I know of at this point. That panel in the picture above that is filthy was sprayed down thoroughly with my hose. The pressure is pretty good - normal garden hose pressure I guess. It does no good. It just gets the dirt wet, and it looks shiny and new while wet. But as soon as it dries you see the dirt remains.

Comments about ""is it worth it"" - that's your call. For me its easy - yes its well worth it. My house is single story. My roof is a very gentle slope. It takes about two hours to get the hose out, get the mop and hose up on the roof, work on the panels, and put everything away again.

Elon has it nailed.

Lidar uses photons (light even if ""laser""). Not much different than regular light.
""image recognition and what to do"" you solve for visual light, then you must solve for Lidar (twice the work).
IF the two different sensors don't agree - what do you do? So added complexity, seldom a good thing.

Extreme case you could use Radar, Lidar, camera and sonar when they don't all agree, what do you do?
Very complex to blend all these different views of the world and then decide what to do.
As Elon says, finding driveable space is the goal. GPS or Maps can't handle construction or broken down cars so not much help.
Watch this video - long & detailed - rewind often to understand. Totally worth the effort. look up words you don't understand.


Certainly not an easy problem. Big Data is key for Machine Learning - no one has anywhere near the data Tesla has gathered.
Elon always the optimist - and his time lines aggressive - when? your guess as good as mine. Elon's better. 2 years? seems certainly 5 years?
RoboTaxi? a new problem - how many ""regulations"" do you see a taxi break just picking up/dropping off passengers? Ask Lyft/Uber drivers.
illegal/double parking - stopping in the road ...

You are seeing better than most, how much work needs to be done. REMEMBER still a work in progress. Best to perhaps think of it as a co-pilot to ""help"" you drive - reminder texting drivers worse than drunk drivers and cause about 8-10,000 extra deaths each years since 2014 - far from RoboTaxi at this point, right? 

Sorry, I don't remember Tony's timeline. He is awfully good, but it is hard to predict, especially the future of things never seen/done before.
Interesting times. Never thought I'd see coffee shops or brewers in SLC. How about a winery and grape growing is that started yet?
And is Provo still caffeine and alcohol free?? I miss Utah Coal and Lumber in Park City. If you ever get chance to go to film festival that was worth doing. I enjoyed it.

enjoy, make friends, help them, they may return the favor - can't have too many friends and remember we are all far from perfect so try to understand our short comings, empathy and forgiveness always helps. You can't control others but you can control HOW you feel/react to others. good luck

Trust your co-pilot but always verify. 
""

I'm skeptical on FSD, here's why -- Elon always goes on about how we drive with two cameras (our eyes). But this isn't really correct, we drive with two cameras connected to our brain. How many times have you been out driving, and you see something off in the distance, but are unable to determine what it is until you get closer, it comes better into view so your brain can make a better determination as to what it is, or you keep watching it, allowing your eyes and brain to use depth perception to help figure it out, then your brain makes a decision as to what to do only once you've determined what it is. I'm not in any way any kind of AI or computer expert, but I'll try to give an example.

Say you're driving along the freeway, there's a guardrail on the right. at the end of the guardrail, you see a rectangular black outline in the distance. Your brain wouldn't know what it is, but you'll keep an eye on it, suspicious it could be a cop. Say you get closer to it and it turns out it is a cop, and it turns on it's overheads. FSD won't react in any way to that. A human will look at it, become cautious that it's about to enter traffic in a hurry, and slow down and give it some space.

This example I'm sure is by no means perfect, but is the best I can think of off the top of my head. I really do not think Elon is correct when he says we use only cameras to drive. We use cameras AND judgement. I understand you can train AI's for most situations through experience, but anyone who has ever been in an accident before can tell you.... there are many different edge cases, and most of them are different. I think we're a long, long way from AI being able to perform anywhere near as capably as a human brain. I do understand that AI will be a better driver, and therefore will be able to avoid most fender benders caused cause someone was looking at their phone, drinking coffee, following too close, etc, but I'm not sure that's going to make it good enough.",,0,0,0,0

Thats a fair analysis. Barriers are here in Germany higher if you listen to the media/auto lobby & government but when you talk to people on streets and I do not mean well informed fanboys as we are the picture is very much different.

People are pretty open minded and want to understand and once they do shift very quickly to Tesla as a very good option to consider. Without viable alternatives visible people have Tesla on their short list. Many strangers did I talked to on streets.

So I believe the government the media and lobby groups won't be able to keep this under control for long and Germans will buy Tesla anyway.

I'd like to keep a list of the REAL unicorns. AFAIK, there are:

1. 2014 P85 and P85+ with AP1 (i.e. ""The 300"")
2. ??

The definition of a ""Unicorn"" is a car that was not orderable and Tesla only made a small number as a transition between two option/feature sets. For instance, a lot of people call the P85D with the Performance Plus suspension a unicorn. It is not. Tesla made thousands of these vehicles for 5 months. It wasn't a transition model, or error, or a few odd one-offs. Also, P85Ds with Ludicrous are not unicorns, as the L option was available to all original owners for a fee. Now if you find a P85DL+, it's a rare car because not many exist, but it's still not a unicorn. Rarity does not mean unicorn status.

I could chime in here. We have a clear rotation of a number of institutional holders leaving the name. Algos will follow along on any trend. You will hear a lot about 180 and longer term technical support and that could well be the case regarding the trading You are seeing some of that now at these levels 

There are a few trade related things working against the stock now The biggest I see is Tesla has a full and health options trade open. All longs who have bought put options as hedges on their positions will eventually put the equity to the sellers of those options which will result in fast and reckless selling As such beware Fridays, especially monthly and trip/quad witching Fridays

As for when it stops, it stops when there is a rotation of new institutional buyers, fund sold on the tech and the FSD story. If they believe it can and will remain solvent there will be a price they reenter. But with the story shift toward FSD and AI and away from 1-2MM cars and 20% margins it will be a new crowd of buyers and we dont know that level as of yet",,0,0,0,0

↑

I'm skeptical on FSD, here's why -- Elon always goes on about how we drive with two cameras (our eyes). But this isn't really correct, we drive with two cameras connected to our brain. How many times have you been out driving, and you see something off in the distance, but are unable to determine what it is until you get closer, it comes better into view so your brain can make a better determination as to what it is, or you keep watching it, allowing your eyes and brain to use depth perception to help figure it out, then your brain makes a decision as to what to do only once you've determined what it is. I'm not in any way any kind of AI or computer expert, but I'll try to give an example.

Say you're driving along the freeway, there's a guardrail on the right. at the end of the guardrail, you see a rectangular black outline in the distance. You don't have enough information for your brain to know what it is, but you'll keep an eye on it, suspicious it could be a cop. Say you get closer to it, you're driving in the right lane, and it turns out it is a cop, and it turns on it's overheads as you approach. FSD won't react in any way to that. A human will look at it, become cautious that it's about to enter traffic in a hurry, and move over and give it some space.

This example I'm sure is by no means perfect, but is the best I can think of off the top of my head. I really do not think Elon is correct when he says we use only cameras to drive. We use cameras AND judgement. I understand you can train AI's for most situations through experience, but anyone who has ever been in an accident before can tell you.... there are many different edge cases, and most of them are different. I think we're a long, long way from AI being able to perform anywhere near as capably as a human brain. I understand that AI will be a better driver, and therefore will be able to avoid most fender benders caused cause someone who was looking at their phone, drinking coffee, following too close, etc, but I'm not sure that's going to make it good enough. This will avoid 90% of accidents, but it won't help with that 10%, which contains a good portion of the really serious ones, in which the brain plays a key role in avoidance.

3698044,Clean your solar panels!,jbcarioca,2019-05-28 08:25:00,"Everyone should be aware that solar panels do receive whatever airborne debris is around. The more atmospheric pollution from any source, the more cleaning one must plan for. 
I installed panels in 1985 on an island I owned in a very remote part of the Bahamas. When I sold it in 2005 the panels had never been cleaned and were still pristine. 
Panels on my house in Miami required cleaning every six months in order to maintain efficiency.
Panels on my house in Rio de Janeiro (a location about 150 meters above the beaches) have been clean since installation in 2010, with a casual spraying ~annually. In Rio we are above almost all pollution and have fairly consistent breezes.

IMHO, if one lives in a dense urban area one should plan for a regular cleaning, and should regularly monitor production efficiency to decide when to clean. 
Personally I have simply used a pressure washer to clean the panels, which seems to always do the job. I do not know whether panels differ regarding their resistance to dust and dirt, but I imagine there are some significant differences.

Is there any source to test panels in this respect? I am soon to begin a new project and I'd really like to know!",,0,0,0,0

My solar installer advised me not to clean my solar panels - just let the rain do it. And mostly I've done that. They were installed June/July of 2014 and the first couple of years I got up there with a mop and a hose and cleaned them, but its a 2-hour pain in the [email protected]@ and I've been lazy.

Well, today I finally got up there and cleaned them again, and based on my Enphase system and my Neurio, I'm now getting 10-12% more power.

The sun has been mostly shining yesterday and today. There are some clouds, but when they clear the panels go to max power. Yesterday that was 4.9kw. Today, so far (its right at noon as I type) I am getting max peaks of 5.4kw.

Moral of this story, clean your solar panels!

 Het aanpassen van de interne bedrading voor de nieuw te plaatsen aardlekschakelaar en automaat.
 Het plaatsen van twee 3640 lasdozen met op beide een viervoudige wandcontactdoos deksel, welke naast de verdeler geplaatst gaan worden.

Technically, the receptacle itself is only rated for 15A. The system is only as strong as the weakest link.

This is how you get set up for detailed historical monitoring with Powerwalls, maybe only when added to Solar. People that have Tesla Solar are used to having statistics with day, week, month, and year. They aren't the most detailed, but better than nothing.

You also have your SolarCity account, at least I do/did, which has a little more detail.

To start, when you add PWs, all the Tesla app has by default is 'Today' and 'Yesterday'. The purpose of this thread is to document exactly what's needed to get the same level of history as you had before with Solar enabled. (Note the Solar section is still there, but it only shows that all the solar generation goes to the home, nothing about how much extra went back to the grid, or to top off the PWs, etc.)

I was told you just need to call and they will enable it. Did that today after the usual long explanation of what was actually 'wrong', and it's now a Tier 2 ticket, which seems sort of ridiculous. More details when I get a response and if it works as it should.

Note that I've also gotten an email (it's been five days since PW install and it came yesterday) that my Solar City account will be shut down on August 1. Reading that again, I can't tell if it's connected to the PW install, or just a general shutdown of SC.

Any additional info to add to the above appreciated as I wait for a response (2-3 days).

We have to keep in mind that the superchargers are in fact a marketing expense. There is little chance they can turn any kind of profit on superchargers given their high initial build costs and so-far reasonable usage costs, unless they go the way of other charging networks and charge prices that are on-par with or sometimes even more than gasoline costs per mile.
""

Has anyone given a price for how much an average supercharger stall costs to install? If I recollect a couple install one in front of their house on the curb and it ran 13k or so with permitting etc. What do you think of as high initial costs?

Cause the usage costs are reasonable (28 cents Kwh). Retail in my neck of the woods is 10 cents and I am certain they get various discounts on that using wholesale electric costs. So that is a pretty healthy profit margin although I am sure it is much lower in other parts of the country.

So some basic math says to pay back that 13K cost over one year would require ~130Kwh of charging per day. That number is almost certainly off by a *lot*, but it could be cheaper than 13k per stall for Tesla to install, their rates could be cheaper or it could cost them more and their rates could be higher. But a busy stall puts out a lot more than 130Kwh per day so...

Point being that with more and more Model 3s out, I certainly think the Supercharger network can make money for Tesla. They do need to build it out more but they are definitely constrained trying to expand everything at once.

""

Daarstraks op de snelweg in Frankrijk nog eens geprobeerd de AP op te zetten. Wel, zoals steeds, met de voet zwevend boven het stroompedaal. Op minder dan een minuut DRIE phantom brakes (allez ja, phantom-full-regen)! Ik was een reeks vrachtwagens aan het inhalen tegen 150, en de zon stond rechts zodat er wat schaduwen waren. Ik was telkens wel snel genoeg op het stroompedaal om telkens maar een paar km/h te verliezen, maar drie keer op minder dan een minuut is wel erg veel. Afzetten die handel, dus... :-(

Een tijd later in België dan toch nog een keer geprobeerd (in een andere richting, minder last van schaduwen). Min of meer doenbaar zo lang ik regelmatig gas bijgaf. Als er in de verte een auto opdoemt, vindt hij ineens dat hij moet regenereren tot 10 km/h boven de snelheid van die auto of iets dergelijks, en dat moet heel dringend dus onmiddellijk full regen. Op de duur weet je wanneer hij het gaat doen, en geef je op voorhand een beetje stroom bij om zijn reactie te verzachten. Op die manier is het min of meer doenbaar, maar dat is toch geen normale manier van rijden.

Na een tijdje nog een mooi voorbeeld van gekdoenerij: Ik rijd links en nader een BMW die achter een vrachtwagen rijdt en waarvan ik vermoed dat hij van vak gaat veranderen om die vrachtwagen in te halen. Manueel rijdend zou ik dan lichtjes inhouden omdat ik weet dat ik anders toch ga moeten regennen, die BMW ging echt nooit achter die vrachtwagen blijven. Merkwaardig genoeg (toeval, of echt knap gezien van het neurale netwerk?) had de Tesla dit zelf (misschien?) ook opgemerkt, alleen gaat hij natuurlijk vol in de regeneratie in plaats van rustig lichtjes in te houden zoals ik zou doen. Dus ik geef een klein beetje stroom bij om zijn reactie wat te af te zwakken tot het strikt nodige... en vervolgens geeft hij zelf nog veel meer gas bij om terug naar de oorspronkelijke snelheid de accelereren. Terwijl natuurlijk op dat moment die BMW zoals voorspeld naar links gaat. Maar nu moet je niet denken dat hij terug gaat afremmen, nee, dat doen we pas als de BMW volledig op ons vak zit en niet eerder! Ik heb hem uitgeschakeld om niet vol in de remmen te moeten.

With this car it needs to be outside the left front fender ( according to my preferred seat position ).

I have had trouble getting my mind to make the transition after 24 years of driving the F-150.

Vinny Gambini:However, if the breaker is 20A, the outlet is the only one on the circuit, and the wire is properly sized, why not just swap in a new 5-20 outlet? Then you're legal.
""

Yeah, this is a really good point. The reason I have not pursued upgrading this receptacle to a 5-20 is because my real intent is to get something much better installed (like a hard wired EVSE or at least a dedicated 14-50). It is only a matter of time before someone in the family that owns the house gets an EV, so I figured they would drive that getting done. ;-)

Even if I can't get a 14-50 in the near term, I was thinking of swapping this receptacle to a 6-20, but it is complicated by the fact that all the faceplates in the house are black (not as commonly stocked), it is in a smaller city so I need to order my parts ahead of time, and the owner has a plug in hybrid with a puny 5-15 EVSE that they use on this specific circuit. So if I upgraded this circuit to 240 then we would need to get the owner a 240v EVSE so they could continue using it (but it would help out their BMW X5 charging speed as well!). Also, if I go to a 6-20 I am not sure what the heck to do for a face plate. I would need a single round faceplate plus a blanking panel or something for the other side. All in black... So that is more challenging to source.



ewoodrick said:

And the possibility of tripping a breaker is huge.

The only redeeming thing here is quad plug, which should be wired for 20a. Not all plugs are
""

So there is zero danger of tripping the breaker in this situation. The danger is that you are using a receptacle which is only rated at 15a but you are drawing 16a continuous through it.

In the US it is fully legal (and exceedingly common) to put 15a receptacles on a 20a circuit. In fact, in residential you are hard pressed to ever find a 20a receptacle. I am not aware of any requirement for quad jacks like that to be 20a.



iluvmacs said:
↑

Technically, the receptacle itself is only rated for 15A. The system is only as strong as the weakest link.

(Now before anyone tries to get me on this other technicality: yes, often the actual receptacle guts are the fabricated identically for 5-15 and 5-20 receptacles, and they just put a different front plate & label on it -- but we don't know that in this case, and it's still kind of abusing the system... if you caused a fire and insurance took a forensic look at it, they will point at this and win).
""

Yeah, totally correct. Though while the receptacle itself is only rated for 15a, it does have to be rated to pass through 20a of current on the daisy chain connections on the back. So we are really only talking about the suitability of the prongs to be able to transfer that amount of current.

And to add more context to @iluvmacs comment, here is a photo of a tear down of *one* manufacturers 5-15 and 5-20 receptacles. Note that internally they are identical (but one has the horizontal slot covered over). Now this does NOT mean all manufacturers do it this way and obviously they are not rated this way...

Tesla's support organization in my experience is quick to try to shift the blame for any issues elsewhere. I think it's in this context that Tesla has ever issued an opinion on anything related to pvoutput.

The pvoutput integration is equivalent to navigating to the Powerwall's local web interface and recording the data shown there every minute.

Not specifically supercharger related but I'm starting a quick jaunt into very rural SW Minnesota to a town called Walnut Grove. Can anyone guess why we are going there? What is interesting about this trip though is that it it is the first time in quite a while where I've had significant range anxiety. The anxiety comes from basically a perfect storm of limited time, limited charging options (all of them L1 and L2) and the need to add about 130 miles of range with those charging options. Oh, and there are some flooding-related road closures. It's a fun challenge but not without stress as there is an important family event that puts a hard limit on when we have to be back at my dad's house early Wednesday evening.

The plan is to stop in New Ulm Minnesota where there is a charge point L2. Most spend a few hours there this afternoon if getting as much as we can. then our Airbnb host has offered to let us charge on her 110, which should get us about 40 to 50 mi tonight. Tomorrow, will stop at a casino on the way back where they have a bunch of Tesla destination chargers. Hopefully, ww will only need to spend an hour or so there as our time will be very tight tomorrow night.
""

I know about Walnut Grove, @theflyer. I was very near there back in Oct 2016 but needed to hypermile a good way to Worthington (260 miles driven on 255 miles or 90% charge) so I had to take the most direct route and ended up bypassing that town but did pass through Sleepy Eye.

Are you also going to visit The Biggest Ball of Twine in Minnesota while you're up that way?

@Intl Professor, if you're not getting software updates, be sure your vehicle is joined to a wi-fi network where you normally park it. TeslaFi.com Firmware Tracker shows that roughly 70% of the Tesla fleet has a 2019.16 version of firmware installed. Many software updates only go out to cars that are logged into wi-fi networks when they are parked. I personally seem to get software updates a couple days after the mass-deployment starts.

For the OP, rear collision alarms are good with me. 10 years ago while on the motorcycle while waiting to make a left turn into my neighborhood, I was just about wiped out by an inattentive driver. They looked down at their radio and didn't see my turn signal or brake lights. Luckily, they looked up in time to go into a full panic stop. Hearing screeching tires behind me, I popped the clutch to try and get moving a little. I got moving a little, but still got tapped from behind (bent the exhaust into the tire, melted the tire a little, but I didn't fall down, so not crazy damage). I still leave extra space between me and the vehicle in front of me and pay attention to vehicles behind me as I slow down. I'll run ""orange"" (yellow/red) lights when I see the person behind me is tailgating bad enough that they wouldn't be able to stop if I did.

3698191,"Shorting Oil, Hedging Tesla",jhm,2019-05-28 09:18:00,"Is The Oil Glut Coming Back? | OilPrice.com


Let’s get back to our original premise how a collapse in the oil market can hurt the share price of Tesla. Are we risking a glut again? Well, it may be more than a glut.


IEA was predicting a 1.3 mb/d increase in oil demand over last year. Problem is, demand so far this year is only up 640 kb/d y/y. So the forecasting geniuses at IEA are off by a whopping 660 kb/d.


To connect this back to EVs (which these savants are challenged to get right), this gap is like a displacement of about 5.5 million ICE vehicles. Well, in 2018, about 2.1 million EVs were sold. Does this explain the 5.5 million vehicle gap? Who says a 1 EV sale only displaces 1 ICE sale? Maybe we have been making a bad assumption here. In 2017 about 96 million motor vehicles were sold. It was supposed to grow by about 3%, but fell by about 0.5% instead. So the new vehicle market was about 3.4 million short of expected growth in 2018. This obviously aggravates the auto industry, and frustrated investors are inclined to vent their anger of Tesla, which boasted record growth. But netting 2.1 from a shortfall of 3.4 million is actually a missed 5.5 million in expected ICE. So this is really not good for the ICE makers of the world.


Could it be that this shortfall of 5.5 million ICE is also driving the missed 660 kb/d gain in in oil demand? Hmm. The whole idea of displacement is that there are fewer ICE vehicles sold as a result of the entrance of EVs. This does not have to be a 1 to 1 exchange. To be sure there are other factors displacing oil demand as we’ve discussed many times before: battery powered ferries in Scandinavia, stationary batteries replace diesel gensets on tropical islands, etc. So I don’t want to be so cute as to suggest that 2.1 million EVs are displacing 5.5 million. I think that is pushing the ration too far, but a ratio that it somewhat greater than 1 to 1 may in fact be realistic. We have an Osborne effect that at least makes this transitory until EV production can satisfy demand for EVs. Also if high utilization use cases (like high mileage commuters and fleet service) are favoring EVs, that also can increase the ratio. So long as EV demand outpaces EV supply, the impact of EVs on oil demand can be at a multiple greater than 1 to 1 displacement.


It should be clear that declining ICE sales is the primary way that EVs reduce oil demand. Obviously, other macroeconomic factors can be also at play in a 5.5 million shortfall on ICE growth. But this 5.5M shortfall is problem for oil demand regardless of the causal factors. Does it explain the full 660 kb/d miss in the IEA forecast? No, the IEA forecasters could have made many other mistakes too. But it is clear that they have a huge blind spot when it comes to EVs, solar, wind and stationary batteries all of which can be applying downward pressure to varying degree on oil demand.


So oil investors too have reason to be frustrated, and they too can vent their anger against Tesla. As long as demand for ICE and oil is threatened and those investors are in pain, Tesla will remain the market whipping boy. These investors are transitioning from “denial” to “anger.” They are in psychological need of an object for their anger. Elon Musk and Tesla fit the bill, and the media are happy to cash in on the rage. I don’t think the beatings will stop until these raging investors fall into a “depression” stage. Tesla is now at a scale where it can inflict material harm on ICE and oil demand. It will be hated and reviled for doing so.

3698196,Tesla Wall Charger - only Tesla cars?,sixela,2019-05-28 09:20:00,"Any car that adheres strictly to CCS Combo 2 specifications with respect to timings can charge -- not only Tesla's. If you set the second DIP switch to ""Legacy"" then even more cars can charge. There remain a few that will sometimes not work, or only work with tricks (like holding a button on an adapter for 10 seconds to simulate a delay between proximity control and charging control signals). But that is, of course, entirely the problem of the car -- standards are standards.

One caveat, though: the TWC will, for a Tesla, balance output over three phases and limit the current to the rotary switch setting on each phase, so if you set it to 16A (11kW over three phases for a Tesla) a car with a single phase on-board charger wil only charge at 3,7kW (i.e. the speed you can get with an EEC 16-ampere single phase socket -- hardly worth buying a TWC for that). 

It's possible to change the switches to allow up to 32A per phase, but then the electrical installation that is upstream (which can be single phase) also needs to handle a maximum of 32A per phase that you are using, obviously -- you really don't want to fry your house when someone with a Model 3 starts charging ;-).",,0,0,0,0

Everyone is going to push to make sure they are on the right side of history and the money. Ultimately the consumer will be forced to play catch up. However, I see a time in the future where the electric market becomes big enough to push gas prices down. This will be an interesting time in history as it could be a better short term buy to get a cheap ice car and pay gas prices that are lower than electricity kw pricing. We’ll see how regulations play out though.

You have a scratched rim right?

""

I would take it as far as I need to. No guarantee a mobile wheel repair will exactly match the same color. 

I love driving my car and the technology is fantastic. That fact does not mean I should let a manufacturer go (which is what they are hoping for from many Tesla fans). They want us to all accept defects or damage caused to our cars because they gave us such great technology. Be by guest and do that but your actions embolden this company.

There are many complaints with the Better Business Bureau here in the US. I may go that route first and if I get no satisfaction I will use whatever resources available. Tesla offers dispute resolution and arbitration at no cost to the customer but my hope is the fact they would have to lay out the money for a $300 issue will cause them to just replace my rim.

They cause it I didn't. Any other car company would own up to their mistake and pay for the rim. All I get is roadblocks.

What company doesn't have a complaint department or executive complaint department you can personally email/call/escalate to? There is no one to talk to. I tried the chat but it is never available. I tried calling the corporate office but the number always says they cannot take your call. This is completely nuts.

I charged at this location this evening with only two empty slots, but one of them seems broken. When I plugged into 4B it didn't start charging and when I got out of the car to disconnect the light at the charge port was flashing orange. I reported it and the guy on the 800 number said the light meant it was charging at a slow rate. Odd since the car didn't report it ever starting to charge. 

A car pulled out of 4A and I took the slot and got a high rate.

A guy in a model 3 with temporary tags and several people in his car pulled in to charge at 4B and I told him about that unit not working. He moved down to the other end to back into 1B next to the handicapped slot. With the ICE traffic coming in behind him it was a bit awkward for him. Traffic isn't expecting to see anyone backing up along these chargers. 

I think at some point it is going to be a lot more awkward to use this charger as the neighborhood grows. I'm sure glad it's there now.

I'm surprised to see that there is ANY difference between the SR and the SR+. Do you know why that is the case? Generally speaking, charging beyond the 220 mile mark is very inefficient, and would rarely be worthwhile.

I think ABRP is assuming you will only charge the SR to 80-90%, so you get shorter legs. I ran a couple of trips to New York from San Diego, and the highest SR+ departing charge level was 85%, which says to me that an SR should be able to follow the same route plan. You would have to charge to 96% or so at that stop, but it shouldn't be any harder on the battery or longer to do than the SR+. When run with the SR it added that same roughly 1.5hrs and a bunch of shorter hops that the OP saw.",,0,0,0,0

3698284,ELECTREK: Tesla starts limiting charge to 80% at busy Superchargers to reduce wait times,d21mike,2019-05-28 09:48:00,"Assuming they allow me to move the charge limit bar and continue charging it of course will not be a problem for anyone. However, maybe they are allowing that for now to see how many people actually change it. If most do not then maybe they will take it away.

For me, I knew before buying I would charge daily at my house and only use the SuperChargers when on a trip. Which is seldom. They even said you should charge to 80% or 90% daily except when you are on a trip and then you can set the charge limit to higher. Like 100%. And with this in mind I decided to get the 75D (Model S) and not speed and extra $20k to get the 100D. Actually if I felt I required the 100D I most likely would not have bought a Tesla because the 75D was pretty much my limit at the time.

So, my car is charged to 80% daily and I only charge to 100% for trips. I generally charge to 100% before I leave the house. Which saves Supercharger usage. If I use the Supercharger more then once during my trip I only charge to 100% when I feel the need to do so because I do not want to wait the time it takes to charge between 80% and 100%. But, I normally charge to 100% once before heading home. As I get closer to home where I would need to charge again if I only charge to 80% the Superchargers are normally pretty busy so it is much better for me to charge to about 100% before heading home at a SuperCharger that is less crowded. Of course if I have spent the $20K for the 100D I would not be having this problem.

I have pretty much convinced my wife to get a Model 3 later this year when her Mercedes comes off Lease. Her main concern was the range of the battery. Since this car would only be used around town with a very seldom trip I felt the Short Range Batter would be fine (220 miles). Now I am not su sure. 220 x .8 is only 176 and that is assuming she will get that much range. My 75D with 259 rated range has never ever charged to 259 when charging to 100%. My daily is about 197 miles at 80%. My wife would not be at all happy with this news of restricting her to 176 miles range. And unless you drive the speed limit you will not even get the rated range. Who does that in California. So, if this change is goes into affect it will force me to get the Long Range Battery to reduce her stress. Again, she might only use the car once a year that requires a 100% charge at a Supercharger. However, the cost difference is less now on a Model 3 for a bigger battery. Maybe another reason for this action by Tesla?????

The real problem that others here seem to ignore (maybe because they are the problem) is the use of Superchargers for everyday use. Maybe they live in an apartment and have no choice and were told hey you can just use a Supercharger on the weekends like you gas up your car or they just feel why not get FREE Supercharging since that is part of the reason for getting the car at the time.

I have said this before that this policy should not be applied to people that are 50 or 100 miles from home since they are obviously on a trip and may need to charge to 100%. People on a trip understand the amount of time to charge > 80% and would only do that if they if felt they needed it for whatever reason. If you feel that people do not understand how charging works then maybe that should be a notice. Hey, you have reach 80% and that last 20% if going to take twice as long and you may not need it. Especially if the chargers are full and others are waiting. I think most people would volunteer to do the right thing. Which is if you do not need it free up the charger for others that are waiting.",,0,0,0,0

Apparently you can override the 80% limit by just adjusting it in the car or the app.

According to Simon Alvarez’s story on Teslarati, if you’re using the car’s trip planner you should be able to geo up to 100%, albeit at a slower rate. This is a quote from his article.

“Among the ways for Tesla to improve the throughput of its Superchargers is to cap the charging sessions of the company’s electric cars at 80%. According to a Tesla spokesperson, the updated Superchargers will charge a vehicle’s battery very quickly until 80%, after which the charging session ends. Provided that owners utilize Tesla’s Trip Planner, electric car owners would still be able to charge up to 100%, though charging from 80-100% will be at a slower rate.”

OT :

Since several countries absolutely depend on oil income, unless the cartel agrees to cap production (and stick by the decision), the price will go down.
""

So a permanent oil glut holding down oil prices? Sure seems counter-intuitive. I recall the cartel capping production in the past, and if they don’t limit production either by agreement or voluntarily, the price should drop precipitously, but eventually they have to lower production or go bankrupt. Maybe they lower production just enough to keep prices just high enough to stay solvent, but if governments keep mandating EVs, the ability to boost demand by lowering prices will be increasingly limited. 

Not debating, just thinking aloud that a permanent downward shift in oil demand seems unlikely to create permanently lower oil prices, but the the transition indeed might not be smooth. A temporary big drop could throw a life preserver to some ICE manufacturers, especially in the US where energy policy is very friendly to oil. So maybe a temporary bounce of ICE sales based on gasoline price drops, in middle-America around 2022-2023?",,0,0,0,0

According to Simon Alvarez’s story on Teslarati, if you’re using the car’s trip planner you should be able to geo up to 100%, albeit at a slower rate. This is a quote from his article.

“Among the ways for Tesla to improve the throughput of its Superchargers is to cap the charging sessions of the company’s electric cars at 80%. According to a Tesla spokesperson, the updated Superchargers will charge a vehicle’s battery very quickly until 80%, after which the charging session ends. Provided that owners utilize Tesla’s Trip Planner, electric car owners would still be able to charge up to 100%, though charging from 80-100% will be at a slower rate.”

I’m curious if this is true.

Arkansas, like much of the country, is currently experiencing massive damaging floods. Its governor, Republican Asa Hutchinson, joined Fox News on Tuesday to lament the huge damage the deluge has caused — moments after praising the Trump administration’s environmental deregulation.

Hutchinson — who has a long record of opposing almost all climate and environmental protections — was first asked whether President Donald Trump deserves credit for his state’s improving economy. He responded that it was Trump’s environmental deregulation that has helped fuel Arkansas’ growth.
Moments later, Hutchinson accidentally pointed out the short-term and long-term ramifications of the administration’s let-the-polluters-pollute approach. His state, he noted, is suffering from “very serious” flooding crisis.

“We’re having the record floodwaters coming down the Arkansas river, much from rain in happening in Oklahoma. They expect more,” Hutchinson observed. He then explained that it was harming Arkansas already.

“We’re having to close certain interstates, so it interrupts travel,” he said. “… We are having hundreds and hundreds of homes having to be evacuated, that [are] gonna be flooded.”",,0,0,0,0

Maybe if it's the last sprint home or something, it could make the difference, but again spending an extra 30 mins charging to avoid a 15 mins stop nearer to your destination, doesn't make sense time wise.

The problem you are missing here is the added wait time for the Superchargers that are FULL or likely to be FULL the closer you get to home. In my case the Superchargers are less busy at the location for my trip home. But once I get anywhere near my home the Superchargers are FULL. My 80% rated charge is 197 miles. But I never get a full 197 real miles unless driving quite slow compared to other drivers on the highway. So add the extra travel time due to slower travel speed and also the wait time at local superchargers and the extra time for charging > 80% is definitely worth it. Also, in my case I only use Superchargers about 4-6 times per year. Wouldn't you think that travelers like myself are not the problem with over crowded Superchargers?

I would take it as far as I need to. No guarantee a mobile wheel repair will exactly match the same color. 

I love driving my car and the technology is fantastic. That fact does not mean I should let a manufacturer go (which is what they are hoping for from many Tesla fans). They want us to all accept defects or damage caused to our cars because they gave us such great technology. Be by guest and do that but your actions embolden this company.

There are many complaints with the Better Business Bureau here in the US. I may go that route first and if I get no satisfaction I will use whatever resources available. Tesla offers dispute resolution and arbitration at no cost to the customer but my hope is the fact they would have to lay out the money for a $300 issue will cause them to just replace my rim.

They cause it I didn't. Any other car company would own up to their mistake and pay for the rim. All I get is roadblocks.

What company doesn't have a complaint department or executive complaint department you can personally email/call/escalate to? There is no one to talk to. I tried the chat but it is never available. I tried calling the corporate office but the number always says they cannot take your call. This is completely nuts. 

I am a big fan of the car, the technology, what it all represents but I will be damned if I give up my rights to have a $40k+ car have defects and me stay silent about it.

My early over-reliance on AP has led me into far too many emergency disengagements, or ""oh sh*t"" situations, in which AP would have caused an accident had I not intervened. Thus the subjective net safety impact on my driving experience has initially been marginally negative, though I'm learning to mitigate that by reducing my over-reliance on AP.
""

Have you seen this report: http://www.safetyresearch.net/Library/NHTSA_Autosteer_Safety_Claim.pdf - They attempted to replicate the results of the NHTSA study concerning the number of airbag deployments after the introduction of autosteering in their vehicles, and in so doing, came to the opposite conclusion the NHTSA originally did:

The model estimated from these specific data helps to answer the question concerning NHTSA’s safety claim about Autosteer, “Is the installation of Autosteer associated with a decreased risk of an airbag deployment crash, controlling for exposure mileage?” The answer is “No.” Table 1 demonstrates that Autosteer is actually associated with an increase in the odds ratio of airbag deployment by more than a factor of 2.4 ​
Tesla has stated that they are opposed to the public release of their data because of the risk that the data may be interpreted negatively. Whether this research is an example of that, or whether it is another demonstration as to why the data should be made public, I can't say for sure.

That said, I don't see how anything other than transparency can be a long-term strategy, given the increased reliance on automation, and their desire to be approved for higher levels of driving automation. Their data will need to be examined by many regulatory approval bodies internationally, and one would hope that their conclusions would be based on sound a discovery, and not later brought into question.

Given the high profile nature of the Boeing incident and what we are coming to learn, I don't think anything other than transparency will work here -- even the regulatory bodies need oversight.

What I say to people is:
1. The overall skate, speed, and the driving dynamics are excellent, second to none.
2. Software is buggy as hell but updates are often and some day most will probably be fixed
3. Service sucks as much as it possibly can
4. Fit and finish is third rate especially if coming from a Lexus or higher end German car.
5. Expect rattles and unusual noises of all kinds
If you can live with these problems than I recommend the car.
""

It seems everyone has different experiences. Service has been fine for me, perhaps because I'm in the Bay Area so Tesla does well on its home turf. I've had no fit-and-finish issues, and my car has been similar quality as the Lexus RX350 and multiple Audis that I've had. And the only unusual noise I've experienced was the metal scraping sound that turned out to be a small pebble stuck between the brake pad and rotor. I also wouldn't say the software is ""buggy as hell"" but it definitely has bugs, and each version fixes some stuff and might break something else but that's offset by actually get new functionality - Emissions Testing Mode, anyone?

Kennelijk wilde de bestuurder of de Tesla Model S niet met de bocht mee naar rechts en is daarna rechtdoor over het gras en door de haag, tussen een lantaarnpaal en een boom door (threading the needle) richting een bedrijfspand gereden. Hierbij werd een wit busje 20 meter verderop gebeukt en werd een Golfje met zn hele voorkant het bedrijfspand in geduwd. Een forse klap, het mag een wonder heten dat de bestuurder plus een vrouw en een kind op het eerste gezicht geheel ongeschonden uit de auto zijn gestapt. Ook in en om het bedrijfspand zijn zo te horen geen gewonden te betreuren, alleen forse blikschade en schade aan het pand. De brandweer heeft de hoogspanningskabels losgeknipt en is verder onverrichterzake naar huis gegaan, wat ik op zich best opmerkelijk vond. Had verwacht dat ze de auto meteen in een dompelbadje zouden stoppen.

De klap was dusdanig hard dat het kenteken van de Model S in de deuk van het witte busje te zien is. Wat me bevreemd is dat er geen enkele airbag af lijkt gegaan. Voor een klap van deze orde is dat toch wel curieus lijkt me?

Ik hoop van harte dat de bestuurder niet een forum-lid was en indien weg dan bij deze gelukswensen met deze relatief goede afloop: het had in potentie veel menselijk leed kunnen veroorzaken.

Thanks for the info. Haymarket is pretty good, it's just that for winter use the local driving really whacks the range. This will help for sure, but the one in Frederick will be the big winner making it possible to just charge whenever I need it during the visit and at a time that works best for me.

Last trip up to Frederick, I took the highway route up 95 and the beltway. Being on Sunday traffic wasn't so bad and I got to Gaithersburg early enough to get an open spot. Topping the charge only 25 miles from Fredneck gave me enough charge so that with a couple of hours charging at Wilcom's Inn I was able to reach Haymarket with no problem. I'm not driving that route during the week though. The traffic is rated the worst in the nation these days. I don't know how anyplace can be worse than Boston, but there it is.

I'll be glad when the weather is warmer and I can get my range back. I'm so glad I bought the max battery pack with my car. Oh yeah, I'm also sold on the utility of destination chargers. A two hour dinner meant I had 30% range back. I tried that with J1772 chargers and I get barely as much charge as it took to drive there. Unfortunately there still aren't very many of those in useful locations around Frederick. I'm trying to see if I can plant seeds on destination chargers in various locations around Frederick. 

Oh yeah, I am typing this from the Doubletree hotel in Rocky Mount which has a bank of Superchargers in the parking lot. Heaven!
""

Destination chargers can be even more convenient than Superchargers/DCFC sometimes. Say driving to your destination would use 85% of your EV range. If there is destination charging, you wouldn't even need to bother to stop along the way at a fast charging station, and could simply park and plug in at your destination, with a 100% charge awaiting you the next morning.

If you are a family of Golden retrievers and life is always good, even in a parking lot when it either 90 or 9 outside and whatever else goes with those extremes, then get SR+ and roll with it.

I wish I was a Golden, but I’m not. Hate to say it, but I’m more like a nervous Chihuahua and the family is similar and we hate pain and drama, so the bigger battery lessens that anxiety a lot.

There will eventually be a day when you are short on time, family in tow, and you’ll need an extra 20 - 30 miles to get to a destination, or get to dinner without worry, or have to cut and run to charge before achieving either of those. Those are the times when a few thousand dollars don’t mean much.

Worse example of this for me was with family of four coming back from Joshua Tree National monument at end of the Thanksgiving Weekend heading to Los Angeles. The math looked good to get home without stopping, and it’s about 4,000 feet downgrade between Joshua Tree and the desert floor, so all regen down the hill. Woohoo! But then as we got closer to the 10 freeway that would get us home, we saw it. A line of brake lights as far as you could see but I thought no worries, Tesla’s do great going slow, but this was not slow, this was stop and go, and once at the 10 we had to start going back up hill a bit and it was after dark and temps in the 40’s. We all had fleece, not parkas, being that we are Southern Californians and I saw my safety margin being cut into being in cold stop and go traffic, and we had gone about 2 miles. So I had to switch plans to stop at the Cabazon Supercharger, only 9 or so miles ahead. That took another hour in holiday traffic and we got there with less than 75 miles of range left (home was about 85 miles). Wife and kids got out at McDonalds while I waited for a spot to charge for 30 minutes, then I had to charge for about 90 minutes (chargers slow because all full). We wandered around the outlet stores and bought jackets to kill time and be prepared for the ride home. I think we ended up home after midnight pretty tired and angry. Sure, epic traffic happens, but the anxiety about charging made it so much worse, and I promised myself to either always get the longest range EV or take the ICE.

Yup. Exactly what @brkaus and @cwerdna said. Not only might it be a 208v feed, but often public J1772 units are a long way from a building so the voltage drop is high. It is not uncommon to only see 200v... (or even if a 240v feed, it could be making it to the car a lot lower)

I would assume that anyone with that many APs has experience in setting up an effective wireless network. I have 5 Unifi APs and can guarantee it's optimally configured for my property. Unifi makes it easy by performing RF scans across both 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands, plus using a building floorplan with wall settings to incorporate signal degradation due to signal blocking. You can then either reduce the power settings manually or automatically configuring everything based on those scans.

This will be a big service deal for Tesla. They had better get their act together in regards to an alternative to $3k per MCU. What you are paying for is a new MCU when all you need is a refurb’d daughter card hosted in the MCU. Tesla should stockpile the bricked MCUs and get a contract in place to refurb the board that has the eMMC chip on it ~ $150-200. Charging $3k to replace the MCU and getting no credit for the core is irresponsible on Tesla’s part.

I just had my MCU changed out for this reason (I believe) on my 2015 P85D at 85,500 miles... under warranty.

Thesis of this sorry piece, which should be dead-easy to refute. Members here that can do much better than I, but here goes:

1. Tesla needs to sell and ship 700k to 1M cars annually to be profitable, and shipped less than 300k in 2018
-> Why is that the necessary number? No basis except that most car margins are about 6% so Tesla must be same. I recall Tesla said gross margins on model 3 were 20%, and they are expected to be much higher in GF3
-> Hmm, Tesla reported a profit in 2018Q4, with a production/sales of about 88k/90k vehicles S/X/3, so 4x to annualized makes it 350k/360k 
One could quibble about special circumstances contributing to that profitability, but would not be expected to change the picture that profitable levels have already been achieved so can be repeated/surpassed, especially with that expanding global demand

2. China cannot save Tesla, if you were to accept #1 above, because, well, trade war makes Tesla too expensive in China, and no that new factory won’t help because they are going to have to go into huge debt to finance that factory and can’t afford it.
->As I recall GF3 is largely funded by Chinese loans with astoundingly generous terms including being “non-recourse”, meaning it is secured by collateral (presumably the factory itself) but Tesla is not actually liable. So I presume there will be more investment from Tesla for GF3 but that the bulk of this horrible weight referred to in the article is already covered by existing loans.
->So the China factory is in fact expected to provide a huge boost for Tesla bottom line and growth.

X-Care here...happy to help answer your questions. The rate will vary between the year, make, model, and odometer of the vehicle. In our analysis when creating X-Care for the Tesla community, we did not see a significant difference in component failure for various options to warrant a pricing methodology that varied per option.



hill said:

More importantly .. why is ANYBODY asking about a warranty so early? You have up to the very last mile/day of your existing warranty to add an aftermarket warranty. Some will even allow a gap, but most won't.
""

It turns out to be cheaper to buy it ahead of time. The rate increases as your vehicle age and odometer increases. So by waiting, you would be paying more. We account for the vehicle still being under warranty so therefore cheaper to get an 8 year right after you take delivery, vs buying a 4 year once your vehicle is 4 years old/has 50k miles.

These Arrangements after all, are designed to make money for their respective companies. (As a 'warranty' some fly-by-night companies would simply declare bankruptcy when they failed to determine cost adequately. The insurance industry, although some have tried to do that can't do it so easily.). Many people feel these policies are BS. We've had 2 different cars with extended policies. One was for a Range Rover, the other for our Prius. Both of the policies more than paid for their self. Usually though, that's not the case, FWIW. Eventually there will be policies available for the 3 Once they figure what the cost should be and still yield a profit to the companies offering.

Vanmiddag een grote klap in Almere op de kruising Oplagestraat/Annie M.G. Schmidtweg. Kennelijk wilde de bestuurder of de Tesla Model S niet met de bocht mee naar rechts en is daarna rechtdoor over het gras en door de haag, tussen een lantaarnpaal en een boom door (threading the needle) richting een bedrijfspand gereden. Hierbij werd een wit busje 20 meter verderop gebeukt en werd een Golfje met zn hele voorkant het bedrijfspand in geduwd. Een forse klap, het mag een wonder heten dat de bestuurder plus een vrouw en een kind op het eerste gezicht geheel ongeschonden uit de auto zijn gestapt. Ook in en om het bedrijfspand zijn zo te horen geen gewonden te betreuren, alleen forse blikschade en schade aan het pand. De brandweer heeft de hoogspanningskabels losgeknipt en is verder onverrichterzake naar huis gegaan, wat ik op zich best opmerkelijk vond. Had verwacht dat ze de auto meteen in een dompelbadje zouden stoppen.

De klap was dusdanig hard dat het kenteken van de Model S in de deuk van het witte busje te zien is. Wat me bevreemd is dat er geen enkele airbag af lijkt gegaan. Voor een klap van deze orde is dat toch wel curieus lijkt me?

Ik hoop van harte dat de bestuurder niet een forum-lid was en indien weg dan bij deze gelukswensen met deze relatief goede afloop: het had in potentie veel menselijk leed kunnen veroorzaken.

This car was listed on Tesla.com and captured by EV-CPO. It does not have the PMSR Motor option code, but it does have the adaptive suspension code. I do not know from visual inspection how to tell if a car has the new motor, but I'm sure someone else might have some suggestions. I don't think there's anything different on the MCU/touchscreen UI, other than the increased range at 100% for Raven cars.
""

So I'm going to go out on a limb and say that Tesla is misreporting these. I test drove the one I linked and you said it's missing the DU03 code which I totally believe it is, but the car itself had 325 miles of range and was pulling efficiency ratings that I'd expect from the motor refresh. I wonder if this has anything to do with the delay in getting these out? I can't see how they could pull off this range and efficiency without the new motors in. It was a test drive model so it was being driven as such and even so 316wh/mi is way too good of efficiency for 30 miles of range on the old motors for a test drive model (~340 would have been typical), but in any case it had about 290 miles when I first got into it at 90%, I had already driven it about 7 miles when I stopped and took that picture.",,0,0,0,0

Here's the skinny, I grew up in So Cal and had all the modded cars one could imagine, Turbo Integra in high school, E46 BMW dropped on 19s, tv, etc. in college, and also had a Chevy truck on the ground and lifted on 35s, so I was a ""car guy"" all through college. 15 years ago I moved to the midwest for work, and haven't modded a thing since. I'm ~40 and do outside sales for a consulting firm, my clients are older, educated, wealthy and rather conservative. So the last thing I need is a flashy car or a car that looks like its owned by the 22 year-old version of me! 

I ordered a M3 the other day, and have to finalize my colors tomorrow to ensure 6/30 delivery and tax credit. Need to decide on:

1) Color - I love silver but without that I don't love any other colors. I am debating on white/white which I think shows the lines of the car best, really shows how moden/advanced the design is, very clean looking, but afraid it will look too japanese (ie my white turbo integra), or too young, or too feminine. Keep in mind I'm in a suit and tie taking clients out every day. Other option is the midnight silver, which looks rich, masculine, more sophisticated, but I just find it to be a ugly gray (my current car is a true charcoal, this obviously has a lot more blue/purple in it).

2) Wheels - I ordered the 19s because the 18s to me are simply not an option, hideous, but for the cost of the 19s plus the value of the 18s I'd forgo, I could easily get a nice pair of aftermarket 19s or 20s. Similar to my color concern, I want the car to look nice but not really look ""modded"" or too unprofessional. Weight is an issue since i drive ~800 miles a week so want to try and maximize range. Ive seen a lot of opinions, some say the 5-6 weight increase on the 20s is huge, others say its more the tires. I don't need racing tires, I'd be happy with a firmer tire built for range over performance. How impactful are wheels with less sticky tires that weight more?

This is all due tomorrow and would appreciate insight from others? Thanks in advance guys!

I'm also a little concerned to leave a hole there as the access point for debris and water. Need some advises from you guys already done it. After few months' usage and the winter season, do you see debris and snow piling up from the cutting hole on the bottom panel? What's your main complaints about the hitch, if any? If you do it all over again, will you still choose hitch or maybe change to the official cross bar?

Seen this?
https://www.digitaltrends.com/cars/tesla-is-dying-and-this-is-how-it-will-end/

Thesis of this sorry piece, which should be dead-easy to refute. Members here that can do much better than I, but here goes:

1. Tesla needs to sell and ship 700k to 1M cars annually to be profitable, and shipped less than 300k in 2018
-> Why is that the necessary number? No basis except that most car margins are about 6% so Tesla must be same. I recall Tesla said gross margins on model 3 were 20%, and they are expected to be much higher in GF3
-> Hmm, Tesla reported a profit in 2018Q4, with a production/sales of about 88k/90k vehicles S/X/3, so 4x to annualized makes it 350k/360k
One could quibble about special circumstances contributing to that profitability, but would not be expected to change the picture that profitable levels have already been achieved so can be repeated/surpassed, especially with that expanding global demand

2. China cannot save Tesla, if you were to accept #1 above, because, well, trade war makes Tesla too expensive in China, and no that new factory won’t help because they are going to have to go into huge debt to finance that factory and can’t afford it.
->As I recall GF3 is largely funded by Chinese loans with astoundingly generous terms including being “non-recourse”, meaning it is secured by collateral (presumably the factory itself) but Tesla is not actually liable. So I presume there will be more investment from Tesla for GF3 but that the bulk of this horrible weight referred to in the article is already covered by existing loans.
->So the China factory is in fact expected to provide a huge boost for Tesla bottom line and growth.

3. Recycled FUD: the popular misquote and misrepresentation of Elon’s comments to imply that he said they could go broke in 10 months if they don’t cut back drastically on expenses. No comment necessary on this BS.

We drove it up to LA over the weekend to confirm repairs. I can honestly say that the shudder is completely gone at all suspension ride heights now. Our service advisor cautioned against calling it a permanent fix.. its an improved half shaft design that has show greater success. Time will tell if its a permanent fix but it sure is nice to stomp on the pedal and accelerate smoothly without shaking apart in the 40-50mph band.

But this gave a chance for me to relearn what the air suspension does, so I did some experiments and here's what I got. It would be interesting to know if the ""new air suspension"" (gen2 air) acts the same way... anybody got it?

On gen1 air: 

If auto-lowering has a speed selected (can be 80+ km/h) ... then the car lowers when that speed is reached. And it will auto-raise (back to standard height) immediately when speed drops to 60 km/h ... Rinse, and repeat as you speed up and slow down the car yo-yo's accordingly. When you park, the car will be at standard height... unless you've geo-located a raise height event at that spot. 

If the auto-lowering slider is all the way to the left, ""Always"" position, you'll get an ""are you sure?"" (limiting Tesla liability) warning. If you say yes, there is no auto-lowering. The only way the car goes to low is by you punching the low position on the suspension screen. The car stays low at any speed from then on, even if you park it, get out, and come back the next day... still on low. You have to raise the car yourself to standard height, or higher. Or if you hit a geo-located raise point (and you're driving slowly enough) the car will stretch legs up to high or very high (skipping over standard height). 

The UI shows (but barely shows - grey on grey) what heights are eligible for manual or geo-located raising. My car will allow high setting up to 55 km/h. And it will allow very high up to 35 km/h. Beyond these speeds, these heights are non-options on the UI and geo-raising will ignore them accordingly if you blow through that point at higher speeds.

I double checked my settings and cabin overhead protection was still on. I leave it on all the time so I don't have to ever get into a hot car! Which is amazing. 

I started to dig into why it was so hot and found this...

At the time, I was on 2019.12.1.2 and noticed that there was text in the information bubble for sentry mode that said that cabin overheat would not work while Sentry was on. However, the UI indicated it was still on (and did not disable the option when sentry mode was on). However, it was clearly not working right.

Now I am on 2019.16.2. The interesting thing is that the wording that said cabin overheat would not work with sentry mode has disappeared from the help bubble. I thought maybe it was a bug, or they updated it to work. However, it still seems to not operate correctly.

Maddening excerpt:
“There's little argument that Tesla faces major survival challenges in the coming months, but downtrends rarely move in a straight line ...”

So their thesis seems to be not that the stock will rebound because the long-term financials are good, but that they will rebound for a short period before tanking permanently.

What in blazes are these “major survival challenges” for a company with solid growth and dominance in a massively expanding market, holding cash reserves plus a new cash infusion to support maximum growth? Sure Q1 was a quarterly numbers reporting disaster, but I thought that investment professionals were supposed to look beyond the headlines , maybe to find that the Q1 numbers were not indicative of any change in the long-term story.

Instead we get the cryptic:

“... long-term relative strength has dropped into the most extreme oversold technical reading in the stock's public history“.

BUT WAIT, if the stock is “oversold” that means it is trading below the company’s fundamental value. So the “long-term relative strength” they are referring to is presumably the relative strength of long-term investors vs short sellers, not the actual “long-term strenght” of the company. Probably lots of folks will read “oversold” to mean something like “over-hyped” and sold above rather than below the real value, because they won’t even follow the link provided on the site.

So maybe a translation of that cryptic phrase is “short seller attack levels have hit new highs against to long-term investors”.

Sorry for the rant.

Yeah, you can't get it to lock up the friction brakes by tapping it at speed. Understandable that it doesn't, given that'd be kinda a scary dangerous thing to have happen from something so easy to mishit.

I don't know exactly where the cutoff is at the bottom end, I just know from experience you can do it with a very small amount of motion (not sure if it was even reading 1mph) and the parking brakes will go on and it'll jerk to a standstill.

My impression is that with the P3D+ in absolutely optimal conditions (about 35mph), 230Wh/mi is about the absolute best you can do - but this is definitely not achievable on the freeway.",,0,0,0,0

This will be a big service deal for Tesla. They had better get their act together in regards to an alternative to $3k per MCU. What you are paying for is a new MCU when all you need is a refurb’d daughter card hosted in the MCU. Tesla should stockpile the bricked MCUs and get a contract in place to refurb the board that has the eMMC chip on it ~ $150-200. Charging $3k to replace the MCU and getting no credit for the core is irresponsible on Tesla’s part.

This is typical of almost all cars that install lowering springs. Alignments address toe. Typically with moderate and mild drops, camber stays reasonably in check. Once camber gets beyond 1.75 or 2 degrees, then you've got some serious tire wear considerations. So basically, you shouldn't need more than just a toe adjustment on these.

I got a reply on 5/13 from email about “Cruise not available” I sent to Tesla Support 5/6. When the support rep asked for details, I sent him a version of my long post #9 here. His response:

“In this instance I would recommend scheduling service at the closest Tesla service center to you so we can bring in the vehicle and run a full diagnostic on the issue at hand. Our expert technicians will be able to pinpoint the exact cause of your concern and will be able to further assist in getting it addressed in service.”​
I’ve had a 5/16 Tesla Service appointment scheduled (via mobile app) since 5/6 (independent of this Tesla Support email incident), and was going to take the Model 3 in tomorrow, but 10 minutes ago I get this text message:

“Good morning Ellsworth ,
This is Saeed with Tesla Motors, diagnosing your Model 3 remotely.
Regarding the autopilot and cruise control issues, I reviewed your vehicle data and noticed a known firmware bug caused this issue. It is going to be fixed in firmware version 2019.16.
At this time there is no need to bring the vehicle to the service center and the firmware will be sent to your vehicle when it is available to release. 
Do you like me to cancel your appointment? 
Looking forward to hearing from you.”​
So this is Tesla acknowledging that this is a software bug that they think they can fix. I’ll recap that our Late 2018 Model 3 LR RWD is currently running 2019.12.1.2 5c87371.

I’ve canceled the appointment and am hoping for the best.

For what it’s worth, my “Cruise not available” condition has never returned since 5/6. But its resolution and absence may turn out to be completely coincidental.

You're still missing the point. Tesla cars and owners are not representative of a sufficiently random and diverse group to be considered a quality sample for a statistical study. It doesn't really matter the actual numbers or how many miles driven. There are simply too many biased variables to be able to show real Autopilot effectiveness. If you can't understand why that is true then you don't understand how scientific studies are designed nor statistical significance works.

The stats that your ""facts"" are based on is equivalent to a study that attempts to measure the average weight of all people in the world by selecting a sample of people that all live in the same town.

If you want to truly study AP safety and effectiveness it needs to be installed on non Tesla vehicles and used by a sufficiently diverse group of people spanning the entire socio-economic and geographic spectrum.

As we wait for the next big software update to drop, I thought it would be fun to play a game. Take the poll (multiple choice) and speculate what features we think the next update will have.

I think Smart Summon is very possible actually since all signs point to Tesla getting very close now. I think traffic light recognition is probably still a few updates away but there is a small chance maybe we get in the next update. Improvements to AP and NOA are always likely, possibly even a new ""feature"" for AP. We just got improvements to the driver visualizations but it is possible that we will get more refinements to the driver visualizations since Tesla is clearly making changes to the UI in preparation for FSD.

Update after 2 days. Still great as they are pretty much now worked in. 
- Road noise is very quiet, impressed about this and comparable to the OE Contis
- Not scientific but over the same road I ran Decibel X. OE CONTIs averaged 86.9 db and the Nokians averaged 85.6
- Energy-wise still comparable during my commute. OE Contis gave me about 450-480wh/mi since it is San Francisco and Marin (hills) on the way to work. Nokians came out about 468wh/mi on the same route.
- Feel was great, more luxurious to be honest in my opinion and took on bumps much better than the Contis. There does appear to be a very slight and softer feel to the turns but not a lot, just noticeable. I also have an BMW M3 with Potenzas and that car feels tight and crisp, but this is an SUV so I don't expect it to feel like a sports car. Also I'm not running the P100D wtih 22inchers!

Indeed!

I see further up the thread though that someone linked to the discovery that if you hold the P button long enough at speed it will engage the brakes and bring the vehicle to stop. Nothing like the old e-brake lock-up though it seems, so no J turns. 

Maybe if you were on gravel or mud it'd break it loose enough? It'd take really good timing though, given the delay between starting the button hold and the braking kicking in. Not clear if you could shift back to D afterward? You'd probably still need to press the brake pedal to shift to D. If that worked you'd hope the car would disengage the parking brake?

....snip.....Could it be that this shortfall of 5.5 million ICE is also driving the missed 660 kb/d gain in in oil demand? Hmm. The whole idea of displacement is that there are fewer ICE vehicles sold as a result of the entrance of EVs. This does not have to be a 1 to 1 exchange. To be sure there are other factors displacing oil demand as we’ve discussed many times before: battery powered ferries in Scandinavia, stationary batteries replace diesel gensets on tropical islands, etc. So I don’t want to be so cute as to suggest that 2.1 million EVs are displacing 5.5 million. I think that is pushing the ration too far, but a ratio that it somewhat greater than 1 to 1 may in fact be realistic. We have an Osborne effect that at least makes this transitory until EV production can satisfy demand for EVs. Also if high utilization use cases (like high mileage commuters and fleet service) are favoring EVs, that also can increase the ratio. So long as EV demand outpaces EV supply, the impact of EVs on oil demand can be at a multiple greater than 1 to 1 displacement.

..... Tesla is now at a scale where it can inflict material harm on ICE and oil demand. It will be hated and reviled for doing so.....
?
""

+1000. Great posts and information! To add to the Osborne effect, younger, more tech savvy people seem to be more interested in Tesla. Perhaps they are delaying automobile purchases until they can afford the lower cost Tesla. Since 2011, we’ve also seen a number of high mileage drivers try to make the 24 KWh Leaf work for 80+ mi commutes, and eventually switch to the longer range Tesla. Low per mile cost vehicles (EV, PHEV, or high mpg hybrids) are best suited to higher mileage driving (taxis, long commutes) in order to reach the TCO cross-over point. While the average Leaf mileage was <40 mi/day, I would expect the longer range EVs will start bringing in the >80 mi/day users, greatly speeding up oil displacement. Add the huge number of electric buses in China, and we’re looking at significant displacement from now on.",,0,0,0,0

Strength product design.
Weakness- terrible manager, can't plan anything, does not understand the customer and the value of money, lack of ethics, emotional, likes to play the victim, stubborn and gets stuck on irrational decisions, does not try to learn, to improve.

Everything Tesla has been doing for the past year with their focus on current quarter has halved demand. It's on them, not on anyone else.
They should have delivered all Model 3 versions in all markets from day one, they should not play with prices, should add a HUD, redesign the door handles, add more options, offer reasonable leasing terms and FSD prices, fix the quality control and service issues.. Take the lower margins to begin with and go up from there, the stock would be at 500-600$ now. Provide proper outlook every quarter with revenue and non-GAAP EPS being mandatory, don't leave room for speculation, educate the press about EVs and Tesla.
Musk just tanked the stock with a pointless comment, he has to be a drama queen all the time, if we lose money like in Q1 , the cash runs out in 10 months, like the press is not gonna forget about the IF. He also seems to confuse GAAP net income and cash flow but that's another matter. And he keeps making pointless or plain untrue statements that hurt Tesla, just because he likes to whine. He's digging his own hole and blaming others.

Instead of working on demand for M3 and MY, Musk got stuck on getting the most out of current quarter , no matter how damaging in the long term. Reservations run out in Q2, second half of the year could be quite problematic since Tesla cut demand in half with all their recent actions. They are not doing anything right anymore. They can't manage it at all, they can't communicate at all, not with the press, investors or general public. Musk just complains while making bad decisions.

A: I have not investigated nor studied the role of electric v. mechanical braking in a Tesla, but there could be related technical issues there as to how much braking is available from the pedal, and how quickly. Logged parameters such as whether or not the pedal is applied (brake switch signal), the brake fluid pressure, longitudinal and lateral accelerometers, yaw sensor, steering angle, and wheel rotational speeds over time can shed light on the unfolding of an incident.
""

As you said, you clearly haven't studied braking in a Tesla at all. That discussion is entirely appropriate to the blended brakes most of the EV market uses.

Tesla has continuously refused to contemplate blended brakes, largely due to pedal feel/response as I understand it.

Thus, with iBooster, Tesla has the most direct brake response possible - the pedal is pushing directly on the master cylinder piston just like an unpowered hydraulic brake system, and the iBooster adds braking force when the car feels it is appropriate.

Electric braking happens solely by the release of the accelerator.",,0,0,0,0

This was actually bought from Tesla (had to go down to Houston from Dallas to pick it up at their location there), with regular title. I was worried a bit about the flood of flood-damaged cars down there, but I don't think this was likely in this case. I didn't think to ask about access to Supercharging. They mentioned it was available, asked how I planned to charge (since I'm about to move in several weeks, currently just using 110V at home, and Supercharger when available/needed), and didn't mention any upcoming or current need to pay for use of Superchargers. And used 2 on drive back from Houston to Dallas. Thinking I should have clarified more here with them, but maybe it's standard to continue access with cars bought from Tesla?

Well... I just tried the Sonax Alcantara and Upholstery Cleaner.

For about 30 minutes, I scrubbed one little spot with the leather and textile brush I got from Amazon. Sadly, It barely made any difference. Definitely not a magic bullet.

The only big gun I have yet to try is isopropyl alcohol, which I often see recommended online for these ultra white vegan leather seats. I'm just hesitant to try this because it would surely dry out the material.

My neighbour knows a lot about this kind of stuff, and she recommended Dawn dish soap. She says that Dawn is far superior to any other soap. Given that Tesla recommend just soap and water for these seats, I figure I'll give Dawn a try before I attempt the rubbing alcohol.

Isopropyl alcohol is recommended in the Model X owner's manual. It will not dry out the synthetic material.

I thought the discussion on HW 3.0 computers was relative to whether the cost of the upgrade is going to delay the upgrades?

So I think there is a big difference in total cost/disruption between 8% FSD and 25% FSD.

I'm of the mind that Tesla will do the upgrades when it will improve the abilities of the car significantly (when the neural net is upgraded sufficiently to take advantage of the extra processing) and that probably won't be until this fall or even into winter.

Have you seen this report: http://www.safetyresearch.net/Library/NHTSA_Autosteer_Safety_Claim.pdf - They attempted to replicate the results of the NHTSA study concerning the number of airbag deployments after the introduction of autosteering in their vehicles, and in so doing, came to the opposite conclusion the NHTSA originally did:

The model estimated from these specific data helps to answer the question concerning NHTSA’s safety claim about Autosteer, “Is the installation of Autosteer associated with a decreased risk of an airbag deployment crash, controlling for exposure mileage?” The answer is “No.” Table 1 demonstrates that Autosteer is actually associated with an increase in the odds ratio of airbag deployment by more than a factor of 2.4 ​
Tesla has stated that they are opposed to the public release of their data because of the risk that the data may be interpreted negatively. Whether this research is an example of that, or whether it is another demonstration as to why the data should be made public, I can't say for sure.

That said, I don't see how anything other than transparency can be a long-term strategy, given the increased reliance on automation, and their desire to be approved for higher levels of driving automation. Their data will need to be examined by many regulatory approval bodies internationally, and one would hope that their conclusions would be based on sound a discovery, and not later brought into question.

Given the high profile nature of the Boeing incident and what we are coming to learn, I don't think anything other than transparency will work here -- even the regulatory bodies need oversight.

For now, all we have is our own personal subjective views, but so far it's gotten us here.

You're at sea level. Elevation is going to be a real factor, on top of air temperate. I haven't gotten all the numbers together from my Custer run, and I don't run Teslafi or such, but the straight physics math of the matter is you should see something approaching 10% improvement in efficiency at 1000m elevation vs sea level. Temperature and weather factors being equal, air destiny drops a little over 10% at 1000m. That's pretty substantial, and really only diluted by the base rolling resistance of the vehicle and on average lower temps found at higher elevations.

So on a warm day in the middle of Nebraska that'll translate to maybe 20wh/mi difference. Suddenly 270wH/mi becomes 250, or in my case 250-ish became sub-230.

This is absolutely true, for freeway runs. Something to keep in mind for people reporting efficiency. Sounds like you got some good data on your road trip.

A system does not need to be 100% to be better than not having it.
AEB/ FCW are assist systems also. If the car has them and still crashes, that is the driver's fault, not the car's.
Airbags do not prevent 100% of fatalities, nor do seat belts. In some types of accidents airbags specifically do not deploy. In sone cases, the airbag deployment increases injury. However, airbags, on the whole, increase safety/ reduces risk of serious injury.

I am positive nothing dripped on the paint in these areas or touched the car, as I work from home, don't drive much, and park indoors in a climate controlled garage. It looks like something that should just rub off, but it does not. Waxing the areas has done basically nothing to alleviate the issue.

IEA was predicting a 1.3 mb/d increase in oil demand over last year. Problem is, demand so far this year is only up 640 kb/d y/y. So the forecasting geniuses at IEA are off by a whopping 660 kb/d.


To connect this back to EVs (which these savants are challenged to get right), this gap is like a displacement of about 5.5 million ICE vehicles. Well, in 2018, about 2.1 million EVs were sold. Does this explain the 5.5 million vehicle gap? Who says a 1 EV sale only displaces 1 ICE sale? Maybe we have been making a bad assumption here. In 2017 about 96 million motor vehicles were sold. It was supposed to grow by about 3%, but fell by about 0.5% instead. So the new vehicle market was about 3.4 million short of expected growth in 2018. This obviously aggravates the auto industry, and frustrated investors are inclined to vent their anger of Tesla, which boasted record growth. But netting 2.1 from a shortfall of 3.4 million is actually a missed 5.5 million in expected ICE. So this is really not good for the ICE makers of the world.


Could it be that this shortfall of 5.5 million ICE is also driving the missed 660 kb/d gain in in oil demand? Hmm. The whole idea of displacement is that there are fewer ICE vehicles sold as a result of the entrance of EVs. This does not have to be a 1 to 1 exchange. To be sure there are other factors displacing oil demand as we’ve discussed many times before: battery powered ferries in Scandinavia, stationary batteries replace diesel gensets on tropical islands, etc. So I don’t want to be so cute as to suggest that 2.1 million EVs are displacing 5.5 million. I think that is pushing the ration too far, but a ratio that it somewhat greater than 1 to 1 may in fact be realistic. We have an Osborne effect that at least makes this transitory until EV production can satisfy demand for EVs. Also if high utilization use cases (like high mileage commuters and fleet service) are favoring EVs, that also can increase the ratio. So long as EV demand outpaces EV supply, the impact of EVs on oil demand can be at a multiple greater than 1 to 1 displacement.


It should be clear that declining ICE sales is the primary way that EVs reduce oil demand. Obviously, other macroeconomic factors can be also at play in a 5.5 million shortfall on ICE growth. But this 5.5M shortfall is problem for oil demand regardless of the causal factors. Does it explain the full 660 kb/d miss in the IEA forecast? No, the IEA forecasters could have made many other mistakes too. But it is clear that they have a huge blind spot when it comes to EVs, solar, wind and stationary batteries all of which can be applying downward pressure to varying degree on oil demand.


So oil investors too have reason to be frustrated, and they too can vent their anger against Tesla. As long as demand for ICE and oil is threatened and those investors are in pain, Tesla will remain the market whipping boy. These investors are transitioning from “denial” to “anger.” They are in psychological need of an object for their anger. Elon Musk and Tesla fit the bill, and the media are happy to cash in on the rage. I don’t think the beatings will stop until these raging investors fall into a “depression” stage. Tesla is now at a scale where it can inflict material harm on ICE and oil demand. It will be hated and reviled for doing so.


Does it now make sense to short oil so as to hedge one’s position in Tesla?

I think the missing 3.4million gap is best covered by the ""osbourning of the auto industry"", where vehicle demand is not meeting expectations as people are all just waiting for more EV's to be available.

And I forgot, did your model account for the consumption bias, where people who buy EV's are most likely to be the high-mileage consumers? I think you said it did, but I don't remember. If not, then less of the difference needs to be covered by the ""osbourning of the auto industry"".",,0,0,0,0

FWIW far as I can tell the ""group"" behind that study is basically one dude and his wife, who do ""studies"" for people involved in class action lawsuits against car companies.... (Ford tire lawsuits for example)

So between that background and the fact they got to their conclusions by tossing out most of the data NHTSA used, I'm....dubious as to their results.


That said- NHTSAs results aren't very useful either as their own sample data was a pretty small set, and was AP1 so fairly irrelevant today anyway.
""

The largest issue with the NHTSA study was already called out by Princeton U's head of vehicle engineering:

Alain Kornhauser, who heads Princeton University’s autonomous vehicle engineering program, has another problem with the NHTSA finding: The data show that, if determination of safety is the goal, NHTSA is asking the wrong questions, he said. He notes that the NHTSA study didn’t assess whether Autosteer was turned on or off when the air bags were triggered.

I don't have an issue with small groups being involved in an analysis, but the studies should be peer-reviewed, well designed, and based on open and reliable data.

Mot suprisingly however, Tesla got as much miliage out of it as they could:

Just after the report, Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk tweeted, “The data show that the Tesla vehicle crash rate dropped by almost 40% after Autosteer installation.”

The company used the finding to support its contention that Autopilot made cars safer. In March 2018, after a Tesla driver was killed when Autopilot drove the car into a concrete barrier, Tesla posted a response on its website that included a reference to the NHTSA study: “Over a year ago, our first iteration of Autopilot was found by the U.S. government to reduce crash rates by as much as 40%. Internal data confirms that recent updates to Autopilot have improved system reliability.”​
See: An agency hid Tesla crash data for nearly two years. Is that any way to build trust in driverless cars?
​In the end, both the NHTSA and the team behind the report minimized the value of the data by stating:

NHTSA: Report was “cursory” and said it was not assessing Autosteer’s effectiveness.
Whitfield: “We did not produce this data. We don’t vouch for it. We don’t know if it’s true or not,” he said.

For me, this only raised more questions and I am looking forward to more careful study.",,0,0,0,0

Not specifically supercharger related but I'm starting a quick jaunt into very rural SW Minnesota to a town called Walnut Grove. Can anyone guess why we are going there? What is interesting about this trip though is that it it is the first time in quite a while where I've had significant range anxiety. The anxiety comes from basically a perfect storm of limited time, limited charging options (all of them L1 and L2) and the need to add about 130 miles of range with those charging options. Oh, and there are some flooding-related road closures. It's a fun challenge but not without stress as there is an important family event that puts a hard limit on when we have to be back at my dad's house early Wednesday evening.

The plan is to stop in New Ulm Minnesota where there is a chargepoint L2. We'll spend a few hours there this afternoon if getting as much as we can. then our Airbnb host has offered to let us charge on her 110, which should get us about 40 to 50 mi tonight. Tomorrow, will stop at a casino on the way back where they have a bunch of Tesla destination chargers. Hopefully, ww will only need to spend an hour or so there as our time will be very tight tomorrow night.
""

I've never been to Walnut Grove, but strangely one of my supercharger trips took me to the place where they filmed the outdoor parts of the television show, which is near Knight's Ferry, CA. I have criss-crossed California many times, but somehow I had never been on that highway until I drove up to the Groveland supercharger from Manteca.

I probably never would have watched that show on my own, but I had two big sisters who always insisted on watching. In the end, I must admit I have fond memories of the show and wouldn't mind going back and watching a few episodes now. It was a staple of early cable television. The house I grew up in is so rural that cable TV was not an option until 2nd grade, but we got it immediately at that point and that would have been around the time when I watched a lot of those episodes (newly in syndication at the time). Even though those landscapes in the TV show are not at all true to what she actually would have experienced in SW Minnesota, I really do enjoy them. Rural Northern California probably has my favorite landscapes in a ""I want to live here"" sense. The dramatic rock formations of the Four Corners region are probably my favorite landscapes to visit, but I never get the ""I would want to live here"" feeling.",,0,0,0,0

My name is Michael Lim and I will be lending my support for our Vancouver delivery team. I am very excited to share the good news that your Tesla has finished production and is en route to Vancouver for final delivery.

Soon, a tentatively scheduled pick-up date will appear on your Tesla Account. This date will be automatically generated based on logistics' best estimate. Please keep in mind this pick-up time is tentative and can be changed. If you have any upcoming vacation plans or times you will be unavailable, please let me know so I can work around your schedule.

At this time, my best estimate would indicate delivery to be feasible in the next 2 weeks. If your Tesla were to become available sooner or later, my colleagues at the local delivery center (or myself) will reach out and help you reschedule.

Once you confirm you are available we can begin to coordinate paperwork together. In the meantime please complete the rest of your online profile, if you have not done so already.

NEXT STEPS: Please get back to me on this as soon as possible. Once these steps are complete we will be able to generate final contracts for your upcoming delivery appointment.

In order to make this process as seamless as possible, we do require the following information to begin your delivery checklist and for your preferred terms to be confirmed in your Tesla Account:


Your Model 3 will be registered under 
You have elected to finance your Model 3; have you completed the Tesla Financing credit application and confirmed payment terms yet? 
*Keep in mind this is a hard inquiry into your credit, additionally please make sure your credit application details match exactly with how you intend to register your new Tesla (i.e. credit application address match registration address, business names, applicant/co-applicant legal names, etc.)
ICBC will be available on-site to help transfer any existing insurance policies, get you started with new registration, find you new BC park plates etc.

You are not considering trading in a vehicle

Your Model 3 will come equipped with new license plates
Can you confirm the above items?

Your delivery location will be at:

The range is not equal to Tesla and is probably the most important feature. Also, where in the USA is the charging network with Tesla type superchargers?

I could chime in here. We have a clear rotation of a number of institutional holders leaving the name. Algos will follow along on any trend. You will hear a lot about 180 and longer term technical support and that could well be the case regarding the trading You are seeing some of that now at these levels 

There are a few trade related things working against the stock now The biggest I see is Tesla has a full and health options trade open. All longs who have bought put options as hedges on their positions will eventually put the equity to the sellers of those options which will result in fast and reckless selling As such beware Fridays, especially monthly and trip/quad witching Fridays

As for when it stops, it stops when there is a rotation of new institutional buyers, fund sold on the tech and the FSD story. If they believe it can and will remain solvent there will be a price they reenter. But with the story shift toward FSD and AI and away from 1-2MM cars and 20% margins it will be a new crowd of buyers and we dont know that level as of yet

""

We should be careful here when we draw comparisons between airbags and autonomous driving systems. Airbags were designed to keep people alive and minimize injury, and this is their only purpose. Currently, autonomous driving systems are designed for convenience with a goal of increasing safety. 

There are early indications, and isolated reports emerging that safety under the right conditions has improved, but it has a long road ahead until we can say that it will have saved as many lives seatbelts and airbags have. Airbags and Seatbelts are designed to be used each time an adult passenger is seated, while the current autonomous systems are designed to be used in specific and narrow conditions.

In 2007, an estimated 15,147 lives were saved by seat belts, and 2,788 lives were saved by air bags. If seat belt use increased to 100 percent, then an additional 5,024 lives would have been saved (Starnes, 2008). When these seat belt numbers are added together to equal 20,171 (= 15,147 + 5,024), this estimate is often referred to as “potential lives saved” or “lives savable.” 

See: https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/811206
​As an aside, I am very grateful to have autosteering as a feature. There are times when I feel that I should not be driving (after long trips when I am fatigued, or all-day hikes in the woods) and would like to rely on it more, but I know that it is not advisable given my own level of responsiveness. For the most part, I use it to reduce my fatigue while driving, but never a replacement for attentive driving.",,0,0,0,0

""Next, any power consumed while the high voltage system is engaged is accounted for. This is only not true for around firmware v6.x and below, which would have no bearing on the Model 3. This data isn't accounted for properly in the energy GRAPH still, in all versions on all vehicles, but it is properly accounted for in the trip meters.

(Detailed technical explanation of the above: The BMS keeps a total lifetime counter of kWh charged and discharged. Since v7.0, the trip meters just snapshot the odometer and these two values when reset. To get the trip data, it just does the math and displays the difference. Since the battery updates the kWh values for both counters any time the HV system is engaged, the trip meters will always have updated information, in motion or not. This is why the power usage in the trip meters will still be updated even if you reboot the system while driving.)

HOWEVER... the accuracy of this is greatly exaggerated at lower power usage. The measurements Tesla makes of charge/discharge is very accurate above 10A or so. Below about 10A (which is 3-4kW) the accuracy can vary greatly, as poorly as +/- 100%, and worse when near zero. So basic vampire drain while sitting, or mild cabin conditioning while idle/off, can be read as way less or way more usage than it really is (S, X, and 3). This gets even more exaggerated when you have slight inclines/declines on a trip where the power consumption/regen ends up near zero often. The sum of these errors can come out to huge variances in the trip meters over a long period.""

First car had 3 large paint chips (something had obviously hit it), and a door ding dent on the drivers side. (Rejected it).
Second car had a paint chip on the edge of the door like something had been slammed in it, and it also had a scratch down to the bare metal on the inside of the door frame. Also had a misaligned trunk and frunk, and a door that had to be slammed to close.

I ended up taking the second car because it was better than the first and I had already sold my daily driver so I needed a car .
The repaint was pretty close and they were able to fix the other issues, but it spend 6 weeks at the body shop followed by another 4-5 visits to fix all the broken clips in the doors where the body shop had removed the panels, scratched the window etc. Trunk broken clip rattle fixed, then noticed the rear door doing the same thing. Had that one fixed, only to have it pop up in the front door. Then the rear door another broken clip and the front door took 2 more visits to fix a rattle the service department caused by not assembling it back together correctly!

One of my doors is still not flush, and their some fisheys in the paint and crack in the paint (but it's on the underside of the trunk so probably not an issue).

My 3 SR+ numbers posted in my other thread (Estimating battery capacity based on Supercharging readout) match fairly closely with yours for the 3 SR+ above.

In your units of mi/hr / kW my number would be 4.57 though (4.5662, and I'd also like to point out that mi/hr / kW reduces to mi/kWh )

I was measuring in terms of consumption, not efficiency, so Wh/km (or Wh/mi). I got a bounded range of 136.000 to 136.187 Wh/km, which I noted the mid-point as being very close to exactly 219.000 Wh/mi (136.08 Wh/km).

219 Wh/mi is the same as 4.5662 mi/kWh

If I remove any assumption about it being a 'round' number 219.0, then the bounded range I determined maps to:
4.5626 - 4.5689 mi/kWh (midpoint is 4.5658 mi/kWh which still rounds up to 4.57).

In any case, we're very close here 

Taking your 4.09 and 4.27 numbers, I get 3P: 244.5 Wh/mi and 3LR RWD: 234.2 Wh/mi

The problem is that I removed all ""nap"" code from streaming.js because I synchronize my local state with TeslaFi. If TeslaFi says the car is sleeping or is trying to sleep, then I close the websocket and stop asking for new tokens.

To me, TeslaFi is perfect as an archive solution but I wanted realtime tracking via MQTT and MongoDB without handing out any account info 

@twall-e I replaced tesla_poll with this: Handle Tesla realtime streaming data

So far so good, longest drive I made was +100km and it didn't disconnect during that time. If I can get the streaming token from TeslaFi then I don't need any teslams api call.
""

i'm also using teslams streaming and adapted the nap code because it wasn't working for me (i guess tesla changes often how they send back data and hjespers didnt update the code anymore).
have been using it for over a year without any issues.

when I recognize the car is about to go to sleep, I exit tsla_poll() and continue calling initstream() with a larger interval.

Calling only initstream will not poke the car with getAux() which prevents the car from sleeping.

you can call teslams.all as many times as you want, the car doesnt wake up. This is useful to check the car status 'online' vs 'asleep' and thus decide if the streaming should start.

3698800,En-Route battery warm up doesn't work on my car,David99,2019-05-28 12:08:00,"Saghost said:
↑

I thought the car normally disabled the battery and cabin heat below 15%?
""

Not sure where you heard or read this, but for sure the cabin heater and AC works normally all the way down to 0%. I have driven my car down to 0% many times and the AC/heater work fine all the way to 0. Cabin overheat protection and keeping the climate control running while parked is disabled below 20% I think. In the early days the AC/heat was reduced when the battery was running low, but they changed at with a software update. 

Looking at the battery heater activity I have seen it turn on many times below 15%. 



ewoodrick said:
↑

Why would you expect the heater to come on in the spring in SoCal?
It's designed for cold weather, not SoCal
""

Because the algorithm isn't based on location or seasons, but on battery temperature  The battery was at aprox 20 C when I arrived at the supercharger. The car then decided that this isn't warm enough to get the best supercharging speed and turned on the battery heater. at aprox 28 C the battery was warm enough and the battery heater switched off. 



Ostrichsak said:
↑

I was going to postulate that perhaps the batteries were already warm enough based on whatever algorithm they have in place for en route warming.
""

If that was the case the car would not have turned on the battery heater when I stared charging. The battery heater kicking in and the charge rate being lower than normal, are a clear signs that the battery was not warm enough. As mentioned, I have seen the battery heater turn on at the supercharger many times when arriving with a ""cold"" battery. This has been a feature for many years. The new 'en-route battery warm up' was supposed to do the exact same thing, except take care of this ahead of time while on the way to a supercharger. Based on my experience the behavior on my car is the exact same as it always was despite the release notes. That's why I'm thinking they didn't include the old cars. 

A similar example of a new feature that never made it to the old cars is the 'torque sleep' feature. In RWD cars it should de-energizes the entire drive unit when the car is not in motion. My measurements show it does not work. I can manually do it and reduce the power draw by aprox 400 Watt. 

Anyways, the whole thing is not a big deal. I don't really care as the situation of arriving at a supercharger with a cold battery is extremely rare. Almost every time I use a supercharger it's because I have driven so much that I'm running low on the battery. That means I have usually driven enough for the battery to be plenty warm.",,0,0,0,0

First off we would like to say thank you for all who have purchased X-Care!! We continue to hear amazing consumer stories about X-Care being the piece of the puzzle that helped them take a jump with buying a used Tesla. Our goal with X-Care is giving that peace of mind to anyone who is trying to buy used vehicle out of warranty or just want an extended service agreement that goes well past their factory warranty. 


At last, we are ready to go live in California on June 1st!!!! However, due to California state law, we, Xcelerate, are not legally allowed to sell you X-Care over the internet/directly to you since we are not a California Dealer.

I guess my idea of the ""stress"" involved in this will be going into my app, clicking SCHEDULE SERVICE and then coordinating my calendar with the suggested times. Heck, it may even be a mobile job done while I am sitting at my desk at work.

As for the timing of performing upgrades, I cannot imagine they would do this any earlier than necessary. Sure, even if they have plenty of modules on hand now that they are installing them in vehicles, there is no reason to tax otherwise already stressed service centers with work that is completely unnecessary at this time, especially when they could be engaged in revenue generating activities. It makes zero business sense.

But they probably aren't even going to overbuild & ship the modules out there to service centers. Yeah, 20K might seem like a ""lowly"" number, but when you have Elon & Zach signing off on every expense, it's not likely they're going to spend money they don't have to.

The way Tesla sets up its webpage to show the total purchase price is brutal to try and decipher (not to mention just plain wrong!). I suspect the final contract is clear(er).

But the way the tax works is that you use the total purchase price of the car to figure out the PST rate (5% GST + 8% PST--in our case because we're $80 over $55k with the $100 A/C charge). Thus, the rate of tax is 13%. But the amount you're taxed on is the purchase price less the trade in value. So you save 13% of your trade-in value.

BTW, this email really helps to explain what we're waiting for in terms of communication/next-steps. Knowing this, I should probably kill the alerts for this forum and get some work done!

Yes, this potential supercharger would have been immensely helpful yesterday. I normally enter and leave Yosemite via Hwy 120 and use the Groveland supercharger, charging to the max since charging in Yosemite is scarce. Yesterday our cabin lost power and a surprise snow storm hit (yes over Memorial Day weekend) and due to the hazardous conditions and a couple of big accidents BOTH Hwy 120 and Hwy 41 were closed. Those are the only was out of Yosemite that have superchargers along the route. I went to the Majestic Hotel but both chargers were in use and the Model 3 on the J1772 said it would be full in 25 HOURS.

So I had to exit using Hwy 140 through Mariposa and went very close to this proposed location. Even though I needed to go northwest back to the Bay Area, I didn't have enough range to reach Manteca, and only 4% remaining if I tried to make Gustine. The slightly safer bet was to go to the totally wrong direction down to FRESNO and arrive with a forecast 7%. So I drove 40-45 MPH the whole way and made it to Fresno.

Since Hwy 140 is the only year round accessible route into and out of Yosemite, I'd say it's essential that it have a Supercharger along the route, and Mariposa would be the perfect place. Hope Tesla can get past whatever is delaying it and get it built before winter hits again.
""

4% should be fine if you are willing to drive slowly like you did. Only exception being maybe if there were snow on the highways you were actually driving. Just lower your suspension if possible and kill the heat and/or a/c. Also, there are most certainly L2 options in Merced and Gustine proper if you are really getting nervous.

A few months ago I would have agreed with you. But more recently my personal experience coupled with the present estimated demand of Tesla EVs says we are not yet ready for the EV experience. I have not spoken to even one person who is seriously interested in buying an EV. In spite of the fact that I drive a somewhat flashy EV (the FWDs always attract attention) no one has ever asked about it in the sense of being interested in buying one rather than just curious or actually trying to get the skinny on just how ""bad"" EV ownership is.
""

My friend in Ohio just bought a Tesla X. Used. $70k. Had been in an accident. That's a lot of money for a car that's been in an accident if you ask me. Anywho, Teslas are very popular in urban areas, namely areas where bmw/merc sell well. Tesla is the new premium option as it is clear from declines in bmw/merc/et al that Tesla is eating into their market share. 
There just aren't many options in the premium segments. If you bump Tesla up next to the incumbents it is clear that Tesla is the way to go.",,0,0,0,0

I was under the assumption that the NN is primarily for image identification and recognition of patterns. Does the NN also control driving behavior based upon the NN deciphered camera feeds? Or once the NN has done its job with analyzing the environment around the car does non-NN code then use the gathered environment data to make driving decisions?
""

Tesla doesn't believe in one neural net to rule them all.

Instead, they have a bunch of them doing different things even within the camera image analysis section.

I'm not sure I've ever seen it explicitly stated how they control the car. I think we know from the investor event and the various folks digging into code that Tesla has neural networks that take the camera data and turn it into an understanding of the environment, and then that understanding gets handed off to something else to provide the reactions.

That something else is probably another neural net, but I haven't seen that stated; it could be hard coded reactions.",,0,0,0,0

Ik heb laatst een lampje in de voordeur proberen te vervangen voor een zogenaamd 'puddle light' die zo'n mooi Tesla logo op de grond projecteert. Echter toen ik het lampje er uit wipte met een schroevendraaier schoot het kabeltje direct los van het lampje. Het aansluitkabeltje was ook nog eens zo kort dat hij direct terug schoot in de deur. Ik kon hem met mijn vinger niet meer terug vinden. Ik bedacht dat ik met een gebogen ijzerdraadje moest gaan hengelen, wilde mijn deur dicht doen en kwam er toen achter dat mijn ruit helemaal omhoog geschoven was (ipv 5 cm naar beneden bij openen) en beschadigde daardoor de chromen raam strip. Gelukkig was mijn raam nog heel. 
Wat blijkt nu...als je het lampje loskoppelt schuift je raam naar de hoogste (gesloten) stand en geeft het scherm een melding dat je de nooddeur procedure voor het openen van de deur hebt gebruikt...??? Raar toch? 
Waarom is er een afhankelijkheid tussen het wel of niet aanwezig zijn van een deurlampje en de stand van je raam?
Uiteindelijk het draadje wel weer terug gevonden en aangesloten op het nieuwe 'puddle light' en alles werkt weer naar behoren.
Maar pas dus op!

↑

This is typical of almost all cars that install lowering springs. Alignments typically address toe as camber isn't routinely adjustable on factory cars. Typically with moderate and mild drops, camber stays reasonably in check. Not sure the ""factory spec"", but once camber gets beyond 1.75 or 2 degrees, then you've got some tire wear considerations. So basically, you shouldn't need more than just a toe adjustment on these. Cars handle best with some negative camber, so even though it may not be in factory spec, if it's < 1.5 degrees, I wouldn't lose much sleep over it. My car is getting lowered now and will get an alignment right after, I'll try to report back what the specs are.

Given wheels don't need to be removed for an alignment, you don't need any special equipment. Multiple people I know have used Firestone and other national chains.
""

I'll look forward to hearing about how your alignment goes. I am planning on installing the springs myself. I found a thread where someone posted the alignment specs.

Well founded speculation. 16.2 was obviously on mass rollout with everybody getting it all over the world, went from 4% to 66% in less than 3 days. Then it stopped. Only a handful of people have gotten it since then, mostly S/X that don't have ELDA anyway.

The previous mass rollout of 12.1.2 shot straight to 85+% and then started to fill up the rest slower as it started utilizing 4G which is more expensive to Tesla, hence why they allow a few days first for WiFi users to get it for free. It ended over 97% within a week total.

Secondly, many people have reported to have gotten an update notification that disappeared right as the TeslaFi stats stopped rising.

All of this can only point to the update having been pulled. The part about the reason being ELDA backlash is speculation but highly probable.

Your logic seems pretty sound. Any speculation why California has a low percentage of the cars that have gotten 16.2 while a high percentage are still on 12.1.1 and 12.1.2 according to TeslaFI Stats?

""

Car industry is just very under pressure, it's probably the most challenged among the manufacturing players, as they're switching technology and migrating private ownership into platform based shared ones. Tesla just leapfrogged profitability to get into the subscription based shared economy. This is too fast for analysts and brokers, very fast for the competition and probably also for the debt exposure of the company. That happens when you decide to lead the way.
IMHO, as far as the foreseable Tesla's future involves:

AI based self driven technology
Car sharing platform
Fully EV drivetrain
Leadership in car (and storage) batteries
then the strategy is the right one. The way to achieve it has to be risky and EM's guidance of on average breaking even every quarter until the car sharing (aka robotaxi) platform is ready sounds like okay to me.

Conjecture on my part, no guarantees: they may actually have started to NOT prioritize CA, as reliable canary testing requires statistically relevant sampling of all user groups. This would imply that the world has been getting the update all at once, which makes sense, and it was then halted at the 66% level it is now - worldwide.

At the same time I post this here, I texted my Tesla sales asking him if a trade-in will lower the tax from 13% to 12%. This was what he replied to me:
""It's always 13% tax for Tesla, irrespective of trade in or not.""
""

He's right, but Tesla does a lousy job explaining what that actually means in practical terms. 

The tax rate will still be 13% (assuming no $80 price reduction), but the purchase price with a trade-in is deemed to be reduced by the amount of the trade in. 

See:

https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/taxes/sales-taxes/publications/pst-116-motor-vehicle-dealers-leasing-companies.pdf

Trade-ins - If you sell a new or used vehicle and accept goods as a trade-in as part or all of the consideration from your customer, in certain situations you may deduct the value of the trade-in from the taxable purchase price to calculate the PST payable. This reduction in the taxable purchase price does not affect the PST rate (i.e. the PST rate is based on the purchase price before the trade-in is deducted).

I charged last night at home. When I went to unplug this AM and go to work, there was a high-pitched whining sound from the very front of the car. Sounded exactly like what this guy recorded a few years ago:

High pitched whining/buzzing noise coming from front of car?

The sound continued during about 10 minutes of my 15 minute commute. It could be heard inside the car especially with the air / radio off and while at a stop light, but could also be heard when driving too -- so it was fairly loud. Definitely from the front of the car. (I have RWD only so no motor up front). Did not change in intensity or pitch when driving vs stopped. I tried reset of screen, and turned off everything that I could and it continued. At least for the guy above, it turned out to be a bad coolant pump.

What was strange, and caught my attention even more, was the battery was lower than expected when I got in the car (making me think that this was draining my battery after it had charged). And the battery went down more than expected during my commute -- again, making me wonder if whatever is causing this sound is affecting battery.

BUT, the Whr / mi was off in the opposite direction: I cross a fairly steep mountain on the way to work. At the peak, I'm always at 600 to 675 Whr / Mi, depending on stop lights, traffic, etc. Today it was 275 Whr / mi. that's impossible. And it wouldn't correlate with the battery dropping faster than normal.

Anyway, just wondering what people thought. Not sure if the sound and the battery and strange energy calculations are related (would seem to be a strange coincidence if not). I've driven it several times since then and everything seems normal now. No sound. Normal battery drain, normal Whr/mi calculations, etc.

Basically too old, yes, but mainly the smaller batteries like that can't take rates that high. Mine is a 2014 S 85, so it also can't take power that high. I did see a little bit higher rates than I had ever seen before on a trip last week. I saw about 117 or 118kW a couple of times, where for several years I don't think I'd seen over 114kW.

So to explain the ""No"" answer: Limited quantities of each type still being built right now, and these remaining minor kinds of gap places like Burns, Oregon or Grangeville, Idaho that are not on Interstates have no need for the ultra fast speed of v3 Superchargers, so let Tesla send the v3 ones to the places that really need that speed and throughput, like these places you are talking about that may have a wait for a stall.

So currently you have a few options for changing cruise speed - either via scrolling the right wheel or by tapping the + or - buttons on the screen.

But did you know that if you do a quick, FULL scroll from top to bottom or vice versa, it will change your cruise speed by 5mph? i.e. do a full scroll from the bottom of the wheel to the top will increase your cruise speed by exactly 5mph. Before this I was just scrolling slowly 1mph at a time, and it was a bit of a drag. This speeds up the process greatly.

Very handy!

The new part, Revision -C (1084333-00-C) (note that's the screen not the entire MCU) is not supposed to yellow. Previous versions from Mid-2016 on were 1084333-00-A and 1084333-00-B. MCU touchescreens prior to Mid-2016 had a different part number all together (These were the leaking screens.)

Tesla is charging customers to replace this screen. It is $1100 for the part and $189 for labor, plus tax. They are charging me to do so today, but I do not want the yellowing and the other options seem to be half-baked, not definite and no timeframe. So it's not good; but the car is not even 6 months old and it having the screen looking like this isn't something I'm comfortable with.

The whole thing sours my opinion on Tesla quite a bit, since they should be fixing this, but at this point it's their way or the highway; i'd rather my car not look like junk, so I gave in, uncomfortably.

SSedan said:
↑

The idea that wheel size directly affects efficiency needs to go away, it is wrong. Often the TIRES on larger diameter wheels are more performance oriented ""stickier"" hurting efficiency but that is not directly due to wheel diameter. The argument about weight has some merit but weight is of little concern in steady state cruise and most range concerns involve steady state cruise.
""

This is basically correct. In stop and go driving, the wheel weight makes some difference because energy is required to get it rotating and energy is required to move the wheel mass forward (double whammy). However, the energy required to rotate is more the further away the rotating mass is from the centre of rotation. This means the the belts and tread compound are the worst offenders followed by the bead area of the tire, followed by the rim surface. (The hub and spokes/disk of the wheel require little energy to rotate). The one other place where the weight will hurt is on a rough road where the up and down motion (even if small) requires energy to overcome.

The thing is that even if you get the same model of tire in different wheel sizes, the lower aspect ratio tire of the larger diameter wheel is still likely to have a more performance oriented tread compound increasing rolling resistance. (For clarity, this would not be the case if the aspect ratio was the same, but then the tire on the larger diameter wheel would be too large for the car.)",,0,0,0,0

Furthermore, there is no return to profitability in 2019. Maybe China and Model Y can save Tesla, however, those income-producing sales are in the future and not 2019 and Tesla will burn through all the cash it has by the end of the year based on its current burn rate.

3699343,"Falcon Wing Doors Refuse to Open, et al",gnuarm,2019-05-28 15:00:00,"I've always had trouble with the rear doors opening properly to their full range in an intermittent manner. I mentioned it as an afterthought the first time I had the car in for repair and a service tech diagnosed a faulty sensor on the driver's side. At that time I didn't know I had a problem on the passenger side as well. I was picking up the car and said I would bring the car back at a later date. Well that turned into a few months. 

In the meantime the passenger mirror showed a fault by not folding out in freezing weather. The driver side mirror was fine. The second time I called the 800 number and they connected to the car and found the mirror was not able to respond to any commands at all, essentially the car said, ""What mirror? There is no mirror."" 

Months later in warm weather, I took the car in for multiple repairs and the service center said they didn't find any problems with these two things. They did find the report from the 800 call, but there was nothing in the record about the sensor fault in the rear door. So they wouldn't fix anything. I had some dancing around by email with the service manager who claimed the doors were doing what they should do... meaning I couldn't prove the doors malfunctioned. So I started taking pictures and sent them. He described the process the door uses to avoid bumping things. Seems they detect the nearest part of an object and construct a box next to and another above the door. It then will not make any movement outside these boxes. So if you have an obstruction low, near the door (like another car) even if it has plenty of room above the obstruction, the door won't open into that space. Even so, I've had the door malfunction when no obstructions were around. 

Regarding the mirror they said the car is not warrantied against ""adverse weather"". So in other words, don't drive when the temperature is below freezing. 

The other day I took some friends to a restaurant and on returning to the house the rear passenger door would not unlatch at all trapping my friend inside. The car said there was an obstruction. It took me a while to figure out what to do. Holding the button from the inside opened the door. That was very embarrassing. I had a friend with a Delorean and we used to tease him about getting stuck inside when his doors wouldn't open. (that is a great looking car even today!) 

The next morning I realized that both rear doors would not unlatch and the rear hatch would not open fully. This is in a spot where there are no obstructions whatsoever. An hour later it was all working normally. 

Later that day the passenger mirror did not fold out after visiting a restaurant. I never realized how important that mirror is. It's actually not required in many states, but I depend on it. In true intermittent fashion, later it was working. 

I'm taking the car in and will see what they do with it. If they give me the stiff arm again, I will be escalating the problem. I am sick an tired of driving a car that is more prone to malfunction and erratic behavior than a politician.",,0,0,0,0

You clearly refuse to see the damage this insanely stupid policy is going to cause to the brand. Tesla is basically telling people that their battery capacity has been reduced by 20%. For a product that already has inherent issues with range anxiety, why would you do this?
""

I really wish you had made this argument originally.. you do have a point here.

HOWEVER 

I still maintain that some restrictions must be placed in order to maintain the integrity and usefulness of an already overworked network. it is, unfortunately, a fine line that Tesla needs to walk here.. not scaring away customers who are banking on 300 miles of range, and making sure that everyone has access to as much range as possible. 

people will obviously grumble.. it is an inconvenience.. that is true. some -- like you -- won't stand for it. others -- like myself -- will take it in stride..

If a trade-in does not lower the tax bracket, it brings less benefit for us (tax saving based on your trade-in car value, not based on your new Tesla total value). Everyone who sale their own car instead of trade it in know that they should sale it for at least 13% more or otherwise they lose money. In my case, I sold (collected deposit only) my car almost 60% (or say 40% depend on which one you put down as the denominator) higher than Tesla offered to me.
""

Agreed. Leaving aside any ""hassle"" factor, if you can sell your car for more than 113% of the Tesla trade-in value, you're coming out ahead. So, if Tesla offers you $10k trade-in, that's the equivalent of $11,300 in a third-party sale. Anything you can get above that is gravy. 

I think where a trade might makes more sense is where the value of your existing car is higher. For example, at $30k, you'd have to sell for >$34k to start pocketing $, so the same % leads to a bigger $.",,0,0,0,0

This will be a big service deal for Tesla. They had better get their act together in regards to an alternative to $3k per MCU. What you are paying for is a new MCU when all you need is a refurb’d daughter card hosted in the MCU. Tesla should stockpile the bricked MCUs and get a contract in place to refurb the board that has the eMMC chip on it ~ $150-200. Charging $3k to replace the MCU and getting no credit for the core is irresponsible on Tesla’s part.

I just had my MCU changed out for this reason (I believe) on my 2015 P85D at 85,500 miles... under warranty.

Such a shame for what is otherwise such a solid car.

Replacing a drive unit is much, much easier than replacing an engine in a typical car, should only take them a couple hours - once they have a replacement ready for your car, but since this hasn't really been happening I doubt the service center has spares in inventory.

I compared and contrasted a home standby generator and solar + a Powerwall. My test was to have a <10 year payback on the solar and price competitiveness with a home standby generator after credits and incentives. We don't have a ton of outages here however we do get yearly wind and ice storms which cause outages and of course there is the always present earthquake risk in the pacific northwest. Powerwall was the winner and I'm quite happy we went through with it (and likely will be SUPER happy during the next outage).

Cost - Powerwall: The quotes I got for the installation and delivery of a generator were higher than the Powerwall even before the federal tax credit. Natural gas is cheap but running your whole house on it is expensive, the Powerwall is essentially utility power prices. Generator maintenance is an ongoing cost, Powerwall costs zero. Both add value to the resale value of a home but I did not dig too deep in to how much they actually return on a sale.

Maintenance - Powerwall: After a home standby generator is installed it needs regular exercise, service, and maintenance (oil, battery, spark plugs). The Powerwall is virtually maintenance free. My time is valuable.

Capacity - Generator: For our home one Powerwall would not support the AC, oven, or dryer. Two Powerwalls could but with those high amp loads they would not last long and adding more changes the cost analysis to the generator. A generator could support all of those without issue. Our home consumes about 25kwh/day if we go about our normal business so a 14kwh Powerwall would last us about half a day with no sun and of course with sufficient solar production from our 8.5kw system it would last ""forever"". (note too that we consume almost nothing at night so on sunny days the Powerwall will charge for night time and the solar would power the home)

Convenience - Powerwall: If utility power is lost the only way you know with the Powerwall is that the lights blip for a quarter second. A generator takes time to spin up, get to speed, and switch over. Generators are loud, noisy, and produce exhaust. You can't even tell the Powerwall is there when it's in use. This is a big piece of mind for me that we don't have to mess with it in an outage.

Practicality - Tie: Our most common grid outages in this region (Seattle) are weather related. In a snow, ice, or wind storm you can be pretty much guaranteed that solar production will be near zero for at least during the storm which really limits the utility of the Powerwall. During an outage like this we could reduce our consumption to the minimum and extend the Powerwall out to about two days or so. Clearly with it's whole house capacity the generator is the winner. However in the event of an earthquake however a standby generator will likely be unusable if the natural gas supply is disrupted. Since earthquakes don't care about weather there is a good chance that if one happened it would be during a time that we get at least some sun. Though heaven help us if the big one hits during a 2 foot snowpocolypse...

X-Factors - Powerwall: The Powerwall is a sexy piece of house candy. Paired with solar it means that we can be almost 100% grid independent for electricity. That's a really good feeling that is hard to quantify. The app is really nice for monitoring the entire system (way better than my solar gateway) and if we ever get a Tesla car there is good potential for V2G or other home integration goodness.",,0,0,0,0

Then how did they get $2.90 eps Q3 '18 on < 90k units? Something isn't adding up. Zev credits were not substantial.
""

Q3 diluted EPS was $1.75.

Q3 Model 3 mix was very AWD/P heavy since it was the first quarter for those variants and US pent-up demand for LR had been mostly met in Q1/Q2. Also, prices for the same configuration were 5-6k higher then than now (depends how you value AP vs. EAP). Q3 was the all-time high for Model 3 ASP, close to 60k vs. COGS of ~47k. 

They also delivered more S/X than normal (27.7k, with 25.2k sold) at better than usual 25% margin. So something like:
S/X: 25.2k * $29k = ~$730m
Mod3: 56k * $13k = ~$730m
S/X leasing: ~$100m

BTW, Model 3 leasing is now a headwind that will hurt profits, especially the first year.

The sticker price was approx $165k and I paid upfront. Today I just went on the online config, and its telling me the purchase price of the exact same config is $108k, despite the fact that “the raven” now has AP3, upgraded suspension and motors (this is without including the $20k value of ludicrous, which will come free).

My car would have had to depreciate by aprox. 35% for me NOT to be able to trade it in for the newer model and net a balance of zero dollars.

3,422 miles at the time of the 3.0 upgrade
7,995 miles currently on the car

CAC was:
198.1 Ah in July 2018, with a mileage of 6,363 mi
185.x Ah now in May 2019, with a mileage of 7,995 mi

It has been a hot minute since I pulled the logs, and the parser was not one that I dealt with easily. That said...

Would someone (looking at you @bolosky ) want me to email them the log so they can add it to the charts? Please advise... I'd really love to see the data.

Really at this point I am just worried about long term battery health. Part of what made this car attractive to me as 2nd owner a year ago was the 3.0 battery, so I want to ensure I am doing what I can to maintain it healthily. At the moment I am back to standard charging it, but it did go through a bunch of Range charges (1,200 miles in 2018, and 850 miles in 2019) on some big road trips (I drove it from Florida to Ohio, and then from KC,MO to Ohio, both times I bought it haha)

TIA for any help/thoughts on this-- and maybe a link to help me get the logs/emailed to whomever wants to spend time analyzing them!

We wondered, if someone here is selling a Tesla even cheaper and would be happy to make a decent offer for a Tesla that's maybe hard to sell due to high milage or a few non-significant scratches. However, the car should be considered to be ready to do a 15'000 miles trip without any major initial repairs or maintenance.

I am going through this emotional stress as most of you are with the recent SP movement... just doesn’t make sense.

I did all the research and I think demand is much more than people imagine. But the stock is behaving as it is all ending for Tesla. Even that stupid NYU prof is shitting on it. But when I think deep again and again I come to the same conclusions. (Can you see if there is hole in the below points).

1) Model 3 demand is very strong, including in the US. (Case already made in my previous few posts). I am guessing 91k deliveries and equal or more production.
2) Fremont doesn’t require additional capex to support model 3. Hence model 3 margins should be near peak expectation. (Q1 volumes were too low to reflect the true margin).
3) SG&A is basically fixed cost heavy (as Tesla doesn’t have margin based sales). R&D cost on FSD and chip is again fixed cost heavy. So both these cost margin should improve significantly.
4) Model 3 margins should improve even compared to Q4 because then Fremont was still building up. End of quarter rush also added multiple costs.
5) China cost is separately assessed.
6) one time restructuring costs from Q1 should reflect as savings in Q2.
7) ASP should remain as high as Q1.
8) the literal x-factors are Raven demand.
9) cash problem should be gone for at least some time, as the quarter should be cash neutral at worse and with new raise there is additional buffer.
10) model Y ramp up is the only big draw.

A few more points. It could be possible that in China Tesla starts taking reservation for SR models. Given the lead time to start build it sure does make sense. Note that in China ICE cars are too expensive get the license for.

So is the case in Norway and Canada where strong incentive will pull a perpetual demand.

So what am I missing?

Installation was relatively easy with their removal kit. Highly recommend getting that kit. 
Definitely need to be patient with removing the T logo. 

I’ve seen two or three others in my area with the rear emblems as well. Honestly they look stock OEM.... obviously inspired by Franz’ model 3 performance rear emblem.

Same here. And that’s exactly what was breaking it for me. Find another way. Find a friend with a Mac. Or find a different tool.

BTW I used same 3rd party tool for 2 other cars for years. The Tesla didn’t like it. But it liked how the Mac partitioned it. Not sure if it was partitioning or formatting or both.

You could also try a small usb drive (I think it’s under 32gb) and try Windows native Fat32. Just as I test.

Just curious - how much are you willing to pay for it? I don't really get the idea that people expect to get every feature going forward, even though they purchased an older product. What other company/product gives you free features in perpetuity even when your product is so old that it can't support the new features? Reading these postings and seeing how upset people get that they didn't get the same features for free as newer buyers - well, if i were Tesla, I would just quit offering updates for free because it upsets so many people (rather than customers viewing updates as a positive, they instead complain endlessly).

It's free! If it works, great. If not, oh well...
""

In general I agree that some Tesla owners feel extra entitled to upgrades that cross into hardware territory. If one gets the car/features s/he paid for, then they are 'square' with Tesla as far as I'm concerned. FSD and even Enhanced AutoPilot functionality vs much-repeated and much-missed timelines seems to me one of the few legitimate complaints where owners may not have gotten what they paid for/were promised. And a few other things like some of the horsepower claims of early Ludicrous cars. A handful of things.

But for the most part, people did get what they paid for...and then some. All the new features via OTA are gravy. 

However, I could make a case for no dash cam/sentry mode for AP2 being a legitimate complaint as well. Why? Well, I remember a tweet from Elon where he said it would be available for ""AP2+"" cars. In the tech world (from which Elon definitely comes), this absolutely means ""two point anything and higher"" and would cover 2.0 and 2.5 cars. The second thing is what @verygreen pointed out: except for having B&W video, there doesn't seem to be any hardware limitations of actually providing dash cam/sentry mode recording. So I think people are unhappy (myself included) that they aren't getting a feature they perceive is possible just because Tesla decided to not include them because they had older cameras that couldn't do attractive color recording.

I would definitely pay to upgrade the cameras to the newer color ones if Tesla provided an upgrade path. While possible, I think the fact that they are working heads-down to reduce service center visits, I can't really see them wanting a bunch of AP2 people to come into service center to get some cheap camera upgrades. 

Perhaps when it is time to roll out the FSD computer, and they do that with mobile service like they are predicting, maybe (maybe!) the ranger will have the option to also update the cameras. Either as part of the upgrade to FSD or perhaps as an optional (additional $) paid update if the owner wants them. Or maybe they will never offer such camera upgrades. I guess we will see.

In the meantime, I think ""faux sentry mode"" is still useful for ""fleet immunity"" and I certainly try to use it often to help with that.",,0,0,0,0

To be fair, though, you're probably counting heating and HVAC use (you probably don't always have it off?). We're wondering about the BEST possible efficiency here.

Looking at your results, the difference seems in line with what I would expect. I'd expect I'd be at 220Wh/mi or so, if I drove similarly (with similar minimal heat use) in the RWD.

Tesla has a double factors:

1) In general, cars do depreciate as soon as you bought them.

2) Also, in general, high tech items might get cheaper too.

I knew that since I bought my first Tesla in 2012. I have bought 3 Tesla cars so far and each time they all depreciate.

Cheaper price and depreciation might be bad for me but as things got cheaper and cheaper and they just get better and better, I still think it's a good thing for every one as a whole.

don't over-stress as the car is fantastic to drive, and almost everything is fixable at a later time; just log it with the rep for record.
""

I did the sr + white with ap. 

I have a small team that will help me with inspection. I will be checking paperwork and interface. Wife will be inspecting paint and tires for chips scratches and defects. Also she will inspect the inside. Neighbor will check panels, trim, windows; the exterior.

Normally, I wouldn’t go through this process in such detail but Tesla does have a history of quality build issues",,0,0,0,0

Hrm. Typically in the US you have 480/277v three phase and then that is stepped down to 208/120v three phase. So then your EVSE would normally get two of the three hot legs of the second step down so 208v nominal. You may just have a really hot output that is supposed to be 208v nominal?

Otherwise in residential and small commercial you have single phase “split phase” which is 240/120v. So nominal for an EVSE would be the two hots at 240.",,0,0,0,0

Then watch this.

""

I am so glad I finally watched this. I am absolutely stunned. Wow.

I do deployments of ML models (including NN-based models) for enterprise, and I guess I assumed the self-driving guys had some kind of magic. But they are describing a non-scalable, piecemeal approach of force-labeling data to do supervised learning. Andrej gives a really good justification for why the use of LIDAR would make this task go far more quickly, at 1:11:15ish. Then he talks about the long tail of situations . . . all of which would have to be manually labeled, and would be unlikely to have enough data points to create high-f1 models (like the example of a pedestrian looking at their phone).

To say nothing about the control system, or any sort of probabilistic event forecast, or deep learning-based decision-making, which will necessarily be required to handle things like the ignorant pedestrian example.

I guess the justification for near-term self-driving advancement would have to be: if Tesla picks off enough common situations and creates point solutions for those situations (like the cut-in event described by Andrej), they could have something that passes for Self Driving but isn't actually a general solution?

The really impressive thing here is that Tesla has created an amazing mechanism for data collection and real-world testing. But man we have got to be years if not decades away from L4-5.",,0,0,0,0

↑

Because the programming is all written by the same company for one product, and as we're learning from Boeing, safety is not supposed to be an add-on option. My car alerts me frequently when I'm driving with no automation when it thinks I'm not slowing down fast enough to avoid the car in front of me (my foot is already on the brake in many instances). This would suggest it's projecting several seconds forward what may happen, and is at least alerting to a potential crash. There was absolutely nothing in this instance, no alert, no intervention, nothing. I'm not expecting it to navigate streets, I'm expecting it to keep me safe in what's supposed to be the easiest, most predictable driving scenario.



Yes, and too many people think that's a suggestion, and put too much trust in it. This is a reality check that should hopefully warn others to not let go as much as they may be doing. I hope that my reactive experience helps others be more proactive. Besides all of that, what's the point if I can't relax a bit while AP is engaged? What part of the driving process am I delegating if I'm still fully engaged, and now not only making driving decisions, but also evaluating whether or not AP is making the correct decisions on top of that?
""

Hello there.. Myself being a recent Model S purchaser, I have stayed away from the AP for the following reasons:.
1. The system is a single unit system with single points of failure. On the way down to Jersey in my 2019 model S, the warning message ""Reduction in Blindspot Capability Encountered"" appeared on the dash. Sure enough I could see that the rear facing cameras were not functioning. I could see cars from my front window forward, but none behind me. 

Now if you take this same autopilot concept and scenario, and apply it to an airplane, and on our landing approach, our altimeter (altitude sensor) goes out, we are now in serious trouble. However, on a plane there are dual systems throughout. If any one component fails, there is an entire other system that can pick up and take over upon notification of a component or system failure. 

In the case of AP and FSD, FSD has to have a dual (non-single point of failure hardware system) in place. Im quite sure that this is indeed going to be a requirement as the national transportation board gets involved in such legislation. From my comfort level, and a requirement before I would rely on FSB with my family on board, I suspect a dual hardware upgrade is likely to be in the works as FSD moves closer to fruition. As for AP, I feel the same applies. As you change lanes, you are relying on that camera 1. functioning, 2, the software interacting properly , 3. the computer running the software to function properly, and 4. the program making the correct decision as to what to do. If there is a failure in any one of those 4 components (and I didn't even mention the auto steering etc) you have a high likelihood of a collision/mishap. 

This is just my opinion, based my experience having seen two cameras go out of service and not return to service until the car had been move to the Car off and back to the Car On.",,0,0,0,0

I am going through this emotional stress as most of you are with the recent SP movement... just doesn’t make sense.

I did all the research and I think demand is much more than people imagine. But the stock is behaving as it is all ending for Tesla. Even that stupid NYU prof is shitting on it. But when I think deep again and again I come to the same conclusions. (Can you see if there is hole in the below points).

1) Model 3 demand is very strong, including in the US. (Case already made in my previous few posts). I am guessing 91k deliveries and equal or more production.
2) Fremont doesn’t require additional capex to support model 3. Hence model 3 margins should be near peak expectation. (Q1 volumes were too low to reflect the true margin).
3) SG&A is basically fixed cost heavy (as Tesla doesn’t have margin based sales). R&D cost on FSD and chip is again fixed cost heavy. So both these cost margin should improve significantly.
4) Model 3 margins should improve even compared to Q4 because then Fremont was still building up. End of quarter rush also added multiple costs.
5) China cost is separately assessed.
6) one time restructuring costs from Q1 should reflect as savings in Q2.
7) ASP should remain as high as Q1.
8) the literal x-factors are Raven demand.
9) cash problem should be gone for at least some time, as the quarter should be cash neutral at worse and with new raise there is additional buffer.
10) model Y ramp up is the only big draw.

A few more points. It could be possible that in China Tesla starts taking reservation for SR models. Given the lead time to start build it sure does make sense. Note that in China ICE cars are too expensive get the license for.

So is the case in Norway and Canada where strong incentive will pull a perpetual demand.

So what am I missing?
""

The current short narrative is that the debt load will outweigh investor support. They are betting that Tesla loses support and effectively can’t raise money. With many firms lowering their evaluation of Tesla it has been easy to tank the stock. I know they’ve been trying to build up demand as an issue but they are quickly seeing that notion disappearing. 
They will come up with something new each time a narrative is proven false. 

But the stock will see more support when delivery numbers hit, and they show a path to profit. Support will be overwhelming at that point. I think the main problem is supporters want to see Tesla play small ball and drive the company slowly to a profit and a long life. Meanwhile, Musk is setting up grand slams and playing for the ultimate knock out punch (autonomy, solar, semi). It’s a big risk but with the stock sitting around $190 the reward may be huge.",,0,0,0,0

Now if you take this same autopilot concept and scenario, and apply it to an airplane, and on our landing approach, our altimeter (altitude sensor) goes out, we are now in serious trouble.

First off, I love my M3dm, best car I’ve ever owned. We gave a deposit within 24hrs of the unveiling of the M3, waited 2+ yrs for it. We financially reached for the dual motor as we were originally planning on buying the standard M3 but at the time it looked like it was going to be an even longer wait and the dual motor just became available that June. 

We paid Tesla 54k , no autopilot, black, this is the peak retail of what customers paid for a M3dm to Tesla. Today every M3 is sold w/autopilot standard (except supposedly the standard) for safety reasons and for less. And yet the early adopters of the M3 have not received an update activating the new version of Autopilot to the early M3 owners.

I’m mad in the fact this group is being overlooked/ignored by Tesla. We gave deposits on good faith, helped Tesla get these cars into production. I tried to call my advisor in Las Vegas and couldn’t get through. Relayed my frustration to my local dealer in Dedham MA. I was told the message would be relayed to the general manager. I have yet to receive a follow up call. 

Am I wrong? Do other owners feel the same way? Sorry for the long post.

I was wondering if the reason behind putting only LR versions on the initial compliance might be because they will initially open only long range available for us that are manufactured in USA. Once the GF3 in China starts producing might bring the SR and SR+ from China here. That would bring the price of those lower models down considerably and allow them to be sold cheaper here.

That's my view as well. China is closer to most of the RHD markets and production costs will be lower than US.

As the owner of an AP2.0 car who was lied to from the start (see late 2016 video, statements made thereafter, and the bait and switch associated with 90D/100D cars in the Spring of 2017), I very much find the decision to limit Sentry Mode to be unacceptable.

It would be nice to have the functionality at some point before another year passes, which is about how long Tesla has told me it will be before a v3 board retrofit is available for my car. Yes, I made the poor decision to invest in FSD now almost 2.5 years ago.

I also recall when ordering the first Model S (late 2014) the statement from Elon that stop sign reaction was coming.

Then, as with the misleading statements associated with Sentry Mode, no clarification was made that you’d essentially have to buy a new car to get the features. In fact, quite the converse was stated repeatedly - that the cars had all the hardware they’d need (except for the v3 board) and that software updates would be Our Salvation.

So..... Tesla has ground to make up to make existing owners whole. Unfortunately, the pattern to date is not encouraging.

I’ve put plans to purchase a 3rd Model S on hold, and regret purchasing the 2nd one.

Happily, in about 3 years, all of this nonsense should be resolved. Plus we’ll finally have the category-killer heavy duty pickup truck that should send fear into the hearts of Ford stealership owners everywhere.

My advice to anyone in the meantime is to spend as little as possible to get into the Tesla game. Unless of course you actually believe that cars are appreciating assets.

In which case I hope you brought enough for everybody.",,0,0,0,0

Soon to be owner here (delivery scheduled for Saturday). Having read the owners manual, I noticed that the car has an interior camera viewing the occupants of the car.

As a point of reference, the power indication on the charging screen shows the power going into the battery and does not include the power for the cooling fans or other vehicle accessories. However, with an MR and SR+ car, there is still ""overhead"" available on a 150kW V2 Supercharger so any power used by the cooling system could be above 121kW. The LR cars are limited on a V2 Supercharger so when the fans are needed, it must reduce the power going into battery. Also, the chargers and stalls are more thermally stressed at 145kW vs 121kW.

There are currently not enough 2170s available to even think about it. And with the Model Y coming I doubt there will be for a long time.

That's the crux of it. If they ramp the 2170s, they'll go to more 3s. If they ramp further, they'll go to Tesla Energy. If they ramp further after that, they'll go to the Y.

Further, we're currently reaping the advantages of Tesla needing to push demand for the S/X. When there's a big interior refresh and battery upgrade? Gonna have to pay for that.

First off, I love my M3dm, best car I’ve ever owned. We gave a deposit within 24hrs of the unveiling of the M3, waited 2+ yrs for it. We financially reached for the dual motor as we were originally planning on buying the standard M3 but at the time it looked like it was going to be an even longer wait and the dual motor just became available that June. 

We paid Tesla 54k , no autopilot, black, this is the peak retail of what customers paid for a M3dm to Tesla. Today every M3 is sold w/autopilot standard (except supposedly the standard) for safety reasons and for less. And yet the early adopters of the M3 have not received an update activating the new version of Autopilot to the early M3 owners.

I’m mad in the fact this group is being overlooked/ignored by Tesla. We gave deposits on good faith, helped Tesla get these cars into production. I tried to call my advisor in Las Vegas and couldn’t get through. Relayed my frustration to my local dealer in Dedham MA. I was told the message would be relayed to the general manager. I have yet to receive a follow up call. 

Am I wrong? Do other owners feel the same way? Sorry for the long post.

what would it take for you to design an after market battery pack, not necessarily of the capacity of the 3.0 pack, how far off do you think we are from having an third party sourced pack?
""

The tooling costs are easily in the 6 digits, and the molds for the sheets would need to be produced if we were to take an OEM battery enclosure to upgrade the cells internally like Tesla did with the 3.0 pack. The next problem is with the firmware changes necessary to make the Roadster accept the battery and possible range increase. We have plenty of over-discharged battery pack enclosures just waiting for replacement sheets.

A redesigned pack would be quite a different endeavor. Changing the physical size could be a challenge, but with today's lithium cells we could produce a similar pack in regards to CAC at 1/3 to 1/2 the original size. The problem may arise in the fact that the battery's degradation and range calculations are based on the specific characteristics of the OEM cell type from a decade ago. We're looking at more firmware adjustments, same tooling costs as before, custom sheet design and molds, and a redesigned enclosure to boot.

It all boils down to the size of the market. There aren't enough Roadsters to make the investment worthwhile. However, if we throw the Model S/X batteries into the mix, then the investment looks more promising.",,0,0,0,0

Americans Still Have 2 Very Big Concerns About Electric Vehicles

TLDR version, lack of charging stations is the #1 concern, and #2 is higher initial price. Charging stations is a psychological issue. People think that they take so many long trips, but most do not. The price concern is just pure stupidity. OK, so your EV costs 10% more right away than an equivalent ICE...almost everyone finances their vehicles. So that extra cost is spread out over your 5 year loan....just like the big gas/maintenance savings are. I guess you could combat that with detailed charts/ads that break the numbers down mickey mouse style.
""

This should be easy to explain but Tesla doesn't advertise, nor do I think they should while demand > supply. It's simple really. Your car payment goes up $200/mo but your gas cost goes down $300/mo and your electric bill goes up $100/mo. But you get a sexy AF Tesla model 3 with <5sec 0-60 and nearly zero maintenance and free AP instead of a Camry, which is not as good a car as they used to be.

It’s a safety issue. You roll it out to small amount of cars and look at logs to make sure failures don’t start happening. If autopilot take overs start spiking on that version they can stop the rollout and figure out why autopilot regressed. If the update bricks cars they can stop the rollout to minimize damage to fleet and backlog of the service centers and call centers. These cars send a gigantic amount of info back to headquarters so they can diagnose and release other small patches to fix issues as they come up in the test fleet.

On general principal it seems wrong, regardless of the feature.

Gotta admit I’ve always been perplexed why people conside OTA updates such a bonus. Yes, things can surprise and delight you by getting better after you bought the car. BUT THEY CAN ALSO GET WORSE!

You have to live with the fact that the car you paid $50+k for a year or five years or ten years ago can become a different car overnight, and maybe not be the car you would have bought. And no rolling it back. 

How many times has Apple ruined old phones with an iOS update? It’s annoying when its a 4-yr-old phone you were about to replace anyway. Not so funny if the new software makes the display run like poo when the car is 6 yrs old and you wanted to keep it for 10. 

What happens if a more assertive board, or corporate partner, or more-empowered COO or GC decides some feature you love is a liability and needs to be enabled every drive, or some nanny like this one has to be disabled every time, only they’re not on twitter listening to owners, and will never change it back?",,0,0,0,0

Agree on all points. But the reaction seems far fetched. Hopefully investors see past that one quarter. Elon lately has been very gracious and controlled. The production is ironed out. GF3 is looking wonders, and orders are flowing in.

I don’t see analyst being angry as a reasonable reaction but market can see through. In retrospect all the price change in Q1 was about trying to figure whether the demand has slowed or it is seasonality and other related issues. Analysts should be able to see that.

Easiest possible explanation: these robinhood youngsters buy 20-50-100 shares in hope that stock will eventually pay for their model 3 or Y in couple of years or so. They probably won't use leverage and or course they don't set stoploss. This robintrack chart is the biggest headache now for shorties, as despite they somehow drove institutions to exit with SEC lawsuit nightmare, they still can't figure out the way to force robinhood crowd to sell: retail is buying this dip like crazy.

Another thing to consider: right now old smart shorts are exiting but to cover they need to buy stock. But they only can buy from a) covering frustrated longs b) newbie shorts who are brave and stupid enough to short at these levels. Hence the constant need to maintain exceptionally high, almost hysterical level of FUD and bearish propaganda.

It really begins to smell like Feb 2016 now. This setup has the potential to explode up to new ATH

It does reduce speed if the speed limit changes, based upon the signage. In places like UT, the speed can be set up to 85MPH, but when you enter certain congested areas, it will reduce. I've seen this numerous times under the older (2018) software version, and even with the latest change as well.

All the no VIN folks. You’ve all completed the pre-delivery items including payment section and hit the blue submit button?

My ownership advisor told me to hold off on the payment section, but then after a three week wait had me complete it and I got a VIN match shortly after.

Also white on white, and it is very hot where I live. I just ordered this ""SUMK Model 3 Glass Roof Sunshade Sunroof Sunshade Compatible for Tesla Model 3 (Roof)"" - Overnight delivery from Amazon. Its for both top glass sections - very good reviews, fraction of the cost for the Tesla accessory version (sold out).

I know that the glass is supposed to filter out some of the heat, but the top of my head gets pretty hot. I will give this a shot and report back. Check out the reviews/photos.

Admittedly, I did not check the brand of receptacle, but it is a custom built home and the electrical work is done fantastic quality. Nothing was done “cheap” in this house. But yeah, good points!
""

If you compare something like a Leviton BR-15 or BR-20 (or Decora equivalent) to its 'residential' brethren (e.g., the '10 pack for $3.99' specials), the difference in construction is immediately apparent. One has a nice steel backing plate running from top to bottom and feels 'heavy'. Nice clamping of the wires, the wipes hold the plug blades firmly in place. The other ... feels like it will twist around every time you plug something into it, and eventually may break. Ok for a table lamp in a living room, but not what one wants for EV charging.",,0,0,0,0

The problem is if they turned on AP for free to you, then I would suddenly want the $$ refunded that I paid for AP (total of $8k, BTW). Tesla doesn’t want to have to refund everyone who bought EAP $2k or whatever the Basic AP costs, so they aren’t going to do that. 

You really missed out on the fire sale they had in March that let you buy both packages for way cheaper than I did. Talk about punishing early adopters, that one really stung.
