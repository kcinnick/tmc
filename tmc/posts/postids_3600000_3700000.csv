Under autopilot, on divided highways, it also does not adjust the speed based on speed limits.

Under autopilot on non-divided and/or local streets, it has a max of speed limit + 5MPH. If you set it at, say, 40 in a 35 MPH zone, it will just keep going at 40 MPH even if the speed limit goes up. If, however, you are going 70 and enter a 35 MPH zone, it'll drop your speed down to 40 (35 MPH + 5), but then increase it back up to your original 70 MPH set speed when the speed limits allow again.

Easiest possible explanation: these robinhood youngsters buy 20-50-100 shares in hope that stock will eventually pay for their model 3 or Y in couple of years or so. They probably won't use leverage and or course they don't set stoploss. This robintrack chart is the biggest headache now for shorties, as despite they somehow drove institutions to exit with SEC lawsuit nightmare, they still can't figure out the way to force robinhood crowd to sell: retail is buying this dip like crazy.

Another thing to consider: right now old smart shorts are exiting but to cover they need to buy stock. But they only can buy from a) covering frustrated longs b) newbie shorts who are brave and stupid enough to short at these levels. Hence the constant need to maintain exceptionally high, almost hysterical level of FUD and bearish propaganda.

It really begins to smell like Feb 2016 now. This setup has the potential to explode up to new ATH
""

I very much disagree that the stock is setting up to explode to ATH. Melt up at some point due to some short covering and longs coming back in, yes, but the current situation is not a setup for a massive climb to ATH. IMO, that is going to take some time, plus we have the deteriorating trade war going on, possible looming recession, stock market up near ATH. Yes, the stock is down over 50% from ATH, similar to Feb 2016, and there is a massive amount of FUD, also similar to 2016, but otherwise this is a different setup than Feb 2016. The market rocketed up as TSLA rapidly climbed back up too. Are we realistically expecting the stock market to go bonkers climbing in the midst of the macro situation, just 7% below ATH? Do we really expect institutions and analysts to immediately flip 180 if Tesla meets guidance for Q2 deliveries with a solid financial result? That's just not going to happen. I think at best we bounce up at some point but still trade in a lower range than we did prior to this long drop. We will likely need model Y rolling before we could jump to a new ATH. I really wish that wasn't the case, but I think it's reality.",,0,0,0,0

I've been on it for about a week and for me it's been the best, most stable version since before Easter, or maybe even since I got the car 51 weeks ago. I've had many versions fail to install (about half the upgrades), often they've wrecked all my EAP features, including TACC which is a huge nuisance on a long road trip. 

I'm happy 16.2 is working great for me but I can empathize with your pain. Odd that some versions ruin it for some cars but work great on others then a different version fixes the broken cars and wrecks ones that previously were working just fine.

You do know that some SR cars do have some of the upgrades as the Plus, probably not the ones coming out in the future but like heated seats and motorized seats, check out what’s on youtube on the SR’s that are out now.

Uh- your chart is the one claiming, wrongly, that SRs come with cloth seats instead of the power vegan leather ones of the SR+ and other physical differences that don't exist between the two.


Anyway, the SRs on youtube will have the seat heaters disabled in software shortly as the ""SR"" software is finally ready....just like the SR+ guys had some MR/LR features turned on at delivery that later got turned off via an update once the ""SR+"" software was ready.

Tesla starts delivering 'Standard Range' Model 3 at ~$35,000 with locked features - Electrek



When it comes to the actual hardware, the two versions of the vehicle, which now start at $35,400 and $39,900, are identical.

The automaker started to deliver Model 3’s to people who bought the Standard Range last month, but we checked with a few owners and they all report still having access to all the same features as the ‘Standard Range Plus’ to this day.

It appeared that Tesla didn’t release a software update for the Standard Range until now.

You need to clarify that statement by adding ""in the markets they are currently being sold in."" Tesla has not opened sales to all markets yet, so that's a misleading statement to make without the clarification.

S and X guidance for 2019 was lowered in Q4 2018 ER because Tesla realized this, so that's a given. Tesla is turning more and more to SR+ because they need to in order to sell all the model 3 that they can produce, even though they do have more markets to sell into. They can produce more SR+, so there's that, but it seems clear to me from the sales mix that Tesla could not sell 100% LR model 3 at the current production level.",,0,0,0,0

FYI, people on this forum value the Tesla cpo warranty at 2-3k. 
Two months ago when I bought my 2014 s60 with autopilot for 31500$ (which was an awesome price) the same cars without the cpo Tesla warranty were going for 36k or more at dealers. So the cpo prices would just kill anyone else. And on top they gave me $3000 more for an old truck then it was worth. Now the dealer prices are about the same, but not much available from Tesla. I liked everything about the car/experience/service so much I’d love to buy another cpo.

Plus the over the air updates keeps throwing new features your way, things like Sentry mode and Dash Cam and Summon are little icing on the cake.

It does reduce speed if the speed limit changes, based upon the signage. In places like UT, the speed can be set up to 85MPH, but when you enter certain congested areas, it will reduce. I've seen this numerous times under the older (2018) software version, and even with the latest change as well. 

What I don't like is when traveling on places like US 50, it can read the ""Truck Only"" speed limit signs of 25MPH as the speed limit for every vehicle at times.

I am going through this emotional stress as most of you are with the recent SP movement... just doesn’t make sense.

I did all the research and I think demand is much more than people imagine. But the stock is behaving as it is all ending for Tesla. Even that stupid NYU prof is shitting on it. But when I think deep again and again I come to the same conclusions. (Can you see if there is hole in the below points).

1) Model 3 demand is very strong, including in the US. (Case already made in my previous few posts). I am guessing 91k deliveries and equal or more production.
2) Fremont doesn’t require additional capex to support model 3. Hence model 3 margins should be near peak expectation. (Q1 volumes were too low to reflect the true margin).
3) SG&A is basically fixed cost heavy (as Tesla doesn’t have margin based sales). R&D cost on FSD and chip is again fixed cost heavy. So both these cost margin should improve significantly.
4) Model 3 margins should improve even compared to Q4 because then Fremont was still building up. End of quarter rush also added multiple costs.
5) China cost is separately assessed.
6) one time restructuring costs from Q1 should reflect as savings in Q2.
7) ASP should remain as high as Q1.
8) the literal x-factors are Raven demand.
9) cash problem should be gone for at least some time, as the quarter should be cash neutral at worse and with new raise there is additional buffer.
10) model Y ramp up is the only big draw.

A few more points. It could be possible that in China Tesla starts taking reservation for SR models. Given the lead time to start build it sure does make sense. Note that in China ICE cars are too expensive get the license for.

So is the case in Norway and Canada where strong incentive will pull a perpetual demand.

So what am I missing?

Looking closely, it's a perfect circle - and right bang/smack in the middle of it there's what remains of an insignificant paint nib, which tells me they (factory?) tried to buff a larger paint nib out with a circular buffer of some sort - and dulled the finish a little. 

What does one do about that? It's maybe 2.5"" diameter circle. Interestingly, it's visible when I took a picture day one in the parking lot on the way home from the showroom pickup, but I didn't notice it personally till now. Again, it's on the rear quarter. 

First pic is day 1 before I even noticed it, about 15 mins after picking up the car. Second pic is when I actually noticed it. It's really generally hard to notice, but if it's something that's simple to fix, I'd like to fix it! I won't lose sleep over it if it's not easily fixable, though.

Thoughts?

Thanks, all.

3700104,Papafox's Daily TSLA Trading Charts,Papafox,2019-05-28 20:39:00,"Today was the day following a three-day weekend and right after market open it's common to see a spurt of buying or selling, depending upon the the mood of the small investors who had been considering TSLA investments over the long weekend. In this case, we saw a buying spurt that erupted shortly after one of the smallest MMDs you can imagine. The buying spurt was predictably followed by a short-seller induced mandatory morning dip to remove the threat of a rally and to probe the level of dread in TSLA shareholders. The results were that longs started buying the 1st MMD, the 2nd, MMD, and each following dip. Thus a series of icicles emerged indicating the market's unwillingness to accept the short-seller pushdowns.

Look at the first transparent grey horizontal line I drew at the red/green line. It stretches almost all the way from 11am until 3pm and shows the ""whack a mole"" area where shorts sold as needed any time TSLA dared to stick its cute little head out of the hole and into the green.

Alas, after 1pm the broader markets began a noticeable descent. TSLA traders ignored the macros until about 3pm when the trend was too obvious and a push down by shorts brought TSLA just a bit above 188. Here I suspect TSLA tried to recover but we saw a second round of capping (second grey horizontal line) that stretched until 3:50pm.

Also, notice the big upturn in TSLA during the final minutes of after-hours trading. The after-hours trading has been a more reliable barometer of sentiment going into the next day's market trading than pre-market trading, I've often found.



Both the Dow and NASDAQ opened well in the green but both descended to close in the red today, with NASDAQ down 0.39%



Looking at the tech chart, I've heard some traders say that you need 5 days of consolidation to define a bottom. Looking at the late march trading, that rule seemed to hold. The early May consolidation lasted less than 5 days but led to a bit of a climb. The May 13 consolidation lasted only 4 days and then didn't hold, and so I'm not much of a believer in the 5 day rule but will keep an eye on it all the same.

Some positive developments with Tesla:
Tesla will provide answer in China Model 3 SR price guessing game on May 31. If Tesla is encouraging guesses as to the price of Model 3 SR in China, do you really expect them to surprise to the high end? Nope, they're getting excitement going and will announce something lower than originally anticipated, which will lead to a great number of reservations, which will drive a stake into the heart of the Adam Jonas ""China is a problem"" theory. Naturally the bear analysts will cry ""low margins"" but Tesla will be able at some point to give the 25% anticipated margins talk. Can't wait, it's going to be fun.

Autopilot is already showing it's going to save a sugarload of Teslas from accidents. This dashcam footage provided by Electrek.co shows a Tesla on autopilot swerving into the adjacent lane in order to avoid a collision from a vehicle that was about to run into the Tesla. What's important is that this is the third or fourth video I have seen of this type of reaction by the Tesla under autopilot. Autopilot is apparently now watching adjacent lanes to see if they are available for emergency egress. Totally impressive! Whoever insures Teslas with this new technology is going to write a whole lot fewer checks to pay for collision damage, and I suspect Tesla wants to be that insurance company. Why give all the profits to Warren Buffet as it takes a small eternity for for insurance companies to lower their premiums on autopilot equipped and often-used Teslas? Also, remember those accidents when a Tesla hit a fire truck or other vehicle that extended partially into the lane? As long as the adjacent line is safe for egress, those accidents should now disappear as the Tesla is finally allowed to depart the lane in an emergency situation.

Finally, I've been in communications with a scientist who has been taking a close look at the Maxwell Technologies breakthroughs, and his view is that they are indeed real and will produce 20% battery cell cost savings. He's also quite impressed with the likely immediate increase in energy density to 300w/kg and a path to go higher with the cells. He offered a PDF from Maxwell that describes the technology well, and a copy can be downloaded here.
This InsideEV article echos his enthusiasm regarding Maxwell
and this video from 13:00 on does an excellent job of describing Maxwell's technology by a chemical engineer

So all in all, Tesla is poised to really make great leaps in the future with it's AI and its battery technology and they continue to pull away from the competition. From today's trading, we saw several examples of how trading didn't go the way the shorts intended. They still can depress the SP by a couple of dollars, but they seem to be losing their mojo on days that don't have a big macro dip. In the short term, the boogy man will be the market's reactions to the China trade issues and whether fears of an economic downturn pop up before TSLA bounces significantly. Never a dull moment.

Conditions:
* Dow down 238 (0.93%)
* NASDAQ down 30 (0.39%)
* TSLA 188.70, down 1.93 (1.01%)
* TSLA volume 10.1M shares
* Oil 58.89

Cause the usage costs are reasonable (28 cents Kwh). Retail in my neck of the woods is 10 cents and I am certain they get various discounts on that using wholesale electric costs. So that is a pretty healthy profit margin although I am sure it is much lower in other parts of the country.

So some basic math says to pay back that 13K cost over one year would require ~130Kwh of charging per day. That number is almost certainly off by a *lot*, but it could be cheaper than 13k per stall for Tesla to install, their rates could be cheaper or it could cost them more and their rates could be higher. But a busy stall puts out a lot more than 130Kwh per day so...

Point being that with more and more Model 3s out, I certainly think the Supercharger network can make money for Tesla. They do need to build it out more but they are definitely constrained trying to expand everything at once.

EDIT: Realized I replied to a really old post, but point still stands.

No, I don't think any of my models have tried to do this. The problem is finding data to base the model on. Without clear data, I am disinclined to model a specific feature like that, but I will be quite willing to state how this may impact the direction of potential bias.

Perhaps when we get some data on the share of EVs used in fleet service, we could pull that out as a special segment. For example, we could model the growth of Tesla Network eventually. We might also know something about the annual mileage of a TN vehicle. If it is say 36k miles, this is 3X the 12k of an average private auto. So a TN vehicle would be worth 3 private EV autos. So this sort of thing could become tractable in the future.

Can anyone who has this model (or has a lot of info about it) answer these questions? Thank you.

1. All P90DL's are advertised as 2.6sec, which is MUCH faster than P85D's (3.2sec) and almost the same as P100DL's (2.4 sec). But from what I've read, P90DL's are nowhere near capable of doing this, especially older ones like mine, which are much closer to P85D than P100DL.

Tesla is publishing those figures on individual pages for every PARTICULAR vehicle. I'd get it if it was a common spec sheet download, but in this case, on the CPO page of my particular P90DL, it literally said 2.6 sec 0-60, and I was fooled by that. Should've known better I guess.

2. I know it's impossible to know which battery my car has , but it's marked as having ""Range Upgrade"" which means it was originally a P85D but got a new battery installed. Does this mean anything in terms of version/performance?

3. Has the ""no launch / max battery mode"" problem been fixed on P90DL's?

4. I don't have anything to measure performance with, so I guess I'll have to rely on the instant power indicator on the dashboard. Do you guys have any idea what kind of max numbers I should be seeing there, on/off max battery and launch mode?

5. The car was listed as having 270 miles of range. I'm sure it does not, especially with the problems the 90kWh packs are reported to have. If any of you guys have P90DL's (esp. earlier ones) can you tell me how much range you have left?

6. Should I possibly ditch this car and get a P85D (not DL) for about 7 grand cheaper?

Thanks a lot for any input here, guys.",,0,0,0,0

Well I finally did it! Ordered a M3 LR RWD 18"" wheels and FSD. I want to thank the entire community on this forum. By reading some reading here, I found the knowledge that was essential in getting just what I wanted and armed me with all sorts of good information. In fact, my OA (Nashville) told me today I could not order a LR RWD any longer. I tried 3 times to tell him that I could. He asked if I wanted the AWD or the SR+. I told him neither and said good-bye. He calls back in about 5 minutes apologizing and took my order. He did have to enter as an AWD along with a change order. Tesla updated my account in less than an hour to the LR RWD.

3700265,"Shorting Oil, Hedging Tesla",jhm,2019-05-28 21:51:00,"So now I am following up on BNEF battery pack cost prediction. BNEF predicts a pack cost of $94/kWh in 2024. Does this accord to basic statistical analysis? Let's see.
A Behind the Scenes Take on Lithium-ion Battery Prices | BloombergNEF










So BNEF is getting to their prediction through three steps. 
1) Estimate the experience curve on cumulative battery volume. They get 18% price decline per doubling of volume.
2) Predict future pack size per vehicle.
3) Predict future EV sales and compute cumulative pack volume.

Steps 2 and 3 are opportunities for the analysis to become poorly calibrated and for modeler bias to creep in. I am taking a shorter route.

1) Estimate experience curve based on cumulative PEVs sold. Pack cost declines 28% per doubling of cumulative PEVs.
2) Forecast cumulative PEVs to be sold.

Notice that I don't need to fiddle around with making pack size assumptions, nor is that even appropriate. Cell cost is about 2/3 of total pack cost, but the pack specific costs may appropriately be thought of as one pack as one unit. Also we should expect the capacity per pack to increase as the cost per kWh declines. So my approach will tend to capture that. Another advantage of indexing the learning curve on EVs sold is that is it fundamentally EV sales that will be motivating R&D and scale up investments.

A critical difference here is that BNEF obtains a learning rate of 18% cost reduction per doubling of kWh volume, but my rate is a reduction of 28% per doubling of cumulative EV sales. So if one were to assume that kWh/EV where to stop growing, you might conclude with BNEF that the pack cost won't come down as fast as my model suggests. So that makes BNEF assumptions for step 2 critical. 

In both modeling cases, though, we need to fight the temptation of thinking that mineral costs set a firm limit to how cheap packs can become. This would only be true if mass and mineral composition of a kWh of capacity were somehow fixed. But with increases in energy density and changes in chemistry, this is simply not true. Part of the experience curve is advancing the chemistry of battery packs finding more dense and low cost options along the way. 

What will slow down the decline of pack costs will the size of the EV market. As EVs saturate the market, they shift to growing a single digit rates, so roughly linear growth. So this make it very hard to keep doubling. Fortunately this is not much of a problem until the 2030s. 

So what about BNEF's 2024 prediction? My model suggest that $100/kWh will be obtained between about 10M to 50M PEVs made (regardless of how long it takes to get there, so my step 2 is not critical.) But assuming my mean logistic forecast in other posts and that the auto market grows about 3% per year, with 95% confidence the $100 threshold will be breached between 2020 and 2023, not as late as 2024. In deed for 2024, I've got a confidence interval from $35 to $78 per kWh. Now as with any predictive statistical model, if conditions fundamentally depart from what has been experienced within the training history, these projections can fail. This is basically the no-black-swans caveat. 

Also in terms of when Peak oil comes, sub-$100/kWh come by 50M cumulative EV sales and oil peaks by about 75M EV sales. So these events seem likely to come just one or two years apart. I still do not see $100 as some magic number when the planets align to make EVs a thing. The fact is every year there is a double digit drop in cost, there will be an increase in EV sales. Moreover, there are many other critical elements to making EVs more powerful and cheaper to build, like improvement in motors, inverters, software control, and more. All of these components also have their own experience curve. So year after year EVs will be increasingly more desirable, more available and more affordable. Singling out the battery pack as having a make or break price risks losing sight of all the many things that advance EV adoption along the way. 

One other little point, at times I've been critical of how BNEF uses a volume weighted average. Tesla appears to be leading the pack. But really this does not matter. Basically, producers that are able to get the cost down lower will tend to grow their sales faster than others. The laggards lose share of volume along the way. Part of what will continue to sustain progress down the experience curve is competition weeding the overpriced packs out of the market. If BNEF were tracking the minimum cost instead of the average cost, we would have more worries about jumps in the technology rather than steady progress to lower prices. So volume weighted averages are just fine by me.",,0,0,0,0

First off, I love my M3dm, best car I’ve ever owned. We gave a deposit within 24hrs of the unveiling of the M3, waited 2+ yrs for it. We financially reached for the dual motor as we were originally planning on buying the standard M3 but at the time it looked like it was going to be an even longer wait and the dual motor just became available that June. 

We paid Tesla 54k , no autopilot, black, this is the peak retail of what customers paid for a M3dm to Tesla. Today every M3 is sold w/autopilot standard (except supposedly the standard) for safety reasons and for less. And yet the early adopters of the M3 have not received an update activating the new version of Autopilot to the early M3 owners.

I’m mad in the fact this group is being overlooked/ignored by Tesla. We gave deposits on good faith, helped Tesla get these cars into production. I tried to call my advisor in Las Vegas and couldn’t get through. Relayed my frustration to my local dealer in Dedham MA. I was told the message would be relayed to the general manager. I have yet to receive a follow up call.

Q3 diluted EPS was $1.75.

Q3 Model 3 mix was very AWD/P heavy since it was the first quarter for those variants and US pent-up demand for LR had been mostly met in Q1/Q2. Also, prices for the same configuration were 5-6k higher then than now (depends how you value AP vs. EAP). Q3 was the all-time high for Model 3 ASP, close to 60k vs. COGS of ~47k.

They also delivered more S/X than normal (27.7k, with 25.2k sold) at better than usual 25% margin. So something like:
S/X: 25.2k * $29k = ~$730m
Mod3: 56k * $13k = ~$730m
S/X leasing: ~$100m

BTW, Model 3 leasing is now a headwind that will hurt profits, especially the first year.


It sounds like most of the Services, other negative margin is from used cars. They don't resell non-Teslas trade-ins and aren't all that great at reselling Teslas. They probably get close to break even on a gross basis, but lose $2k+ per car net after the expenses of handling, repairing, transporting, etc.

So back in early-mid 2018, when you were forecasting for Q3 2018, what was your forecast? And how close/far did you get? I'm pretty sure no one (bull or bear) was forecasting 1.75. Why were you personally off? What assumptions did you get wrong?",,0,0,0,0

All this feedback is odd. Tesla's blog states emergency lane departure avoidance is only supposed to kick in if there could be a collision or the car could leave the road. Sounds like it is not working as intended? I'm guessing if it actually worked the way they specified, then leaving it on by default would make sense.

Also, normal lane departure avoidance is only supposed to work if your hands are not on the wheel. You'd think the emergency version would work the same way?
""

It actually is working the way you describe above at least on my car anyway. If the car is about to leave the road it activates but also displays a message which I think is misleading as it says ""Potential collision detected"" even if there is no obvious collision about to happen, roadway departure at speed often doesn't end well. I think that message is what is leading people to make the claim of ""false positive"" .

As for non-roadway lane departures where you drift into a travel lane next to you or into oncoming traffic lane, I have not had an issue steering over the cars attempt to keep the car in the lane I was originally in. Yes, it does give a little bit of resistance but I wouldn't say it was any more than what it takes to pull it out of AP by moving the steering wheel. 

I think it is just a new feature that people are not use to and like anything new and different than they are use to it takes time to learn and adjust to the system. I for one like the additional safety and do think they need to change it.",,0,0,0,0

It looks like that truck had turn signal on to signal left merge, but did cross the solid line half a car length too soon before the dashed single white line starts.

Should AP actually slow down while approaching lane merges? The Model 3 was behind the truck(while turn signal flashing) when it sped past on the left. An attentive driver probably will slow down or move to left lane already.
""

As I posted earlier in this thread, NOA did in fact, just the other day, slow for two cars to merge thus avoiding blocking the two merging cars. 

However, there’s a basic difference between the lanes in the video here and my situation: the two merging lanes in the video are quite long suggesting the car recognized that and knew there was no immediate need to get out of the way or yield, while in my situation the single merge lane was very short and ended abruptly. 

It’s also technically the responsibility of the merging car to adjust speed accordingly and you know, merge. Defensive drivers will yield for merging cars. Aggressive drivers will accelerate to get in front of merging cars and jerks will drive like they’re the only ones on the road and happily sit in your blind spot while you try to merge.",,0,0,0,0

Although Elon Musk said if you bought FSD, you'll get a computer swap to HW3.0 from any hardware from 2.0 and up.

However, contrary to conventional assumption, for used cars: Only HW2.5 eligible for FSD and no HW2.0 is eligible for FSD. This has been announced before so what you heard is not new:

Was just told that AP 2.0 won't get FSD.

HW2.5 started in Model 3 production since 7/2017

and in Model S and X since 8/23/2017 (some still got HW2.0 for production prior to 8/22/2017.) So, to be sure, I would look at the driver's door sill label with the production month and year starting from September 2017 and later.

It actually is working the way you describe above at least on my car anyway. If the car is about to leave the road it activates but also displays a message which I think is misleading as it says ""Potential collision detected"" even if there is no obvious collision about to happen, roadway departure at speed often doesn't end well. I think that message is what is leading people to make the claim of ""false positive"" .

As for non-roadway lane departures where you drift into a travel lane next to you or into oncoming traffic lane, I have not had an issue steering over the cars attempt to keep the car in the lane I was originally in. Yes, it does give a little bit of resistance but I wouldn't say it was any more than what it takes to pull it out of AP by moving the steering wheel. 

I think it is just a new feature that people are not use to and like anything new and different than they are use to it takes time to learn and adjust to the system. I for one like the additional safety and do think they need to change it.
""


DEFINITELY NOT.

Driving down the center of a lane, spooks at a truck passing me on the left, and shoves me over right on the lane line to the right, with a Semi in it. Neither the Truck nor the Semi were in my lane/coming in my lane. I was in the center of the lane. No Emergency in any way (other than what it caused)

Another instance, in the center of my lane on an off-ramp, it spooks at an arrow in the center of the lane, and kicks to the right.

Had another one this afternoon. Spooked at a big cactus which is right on the edge of the road. Kicked me left onto the wrong side of the road. Luckily nothing coming the other way. If there had been, there would be NO TIME to correct the steering input from the car, or resist the change.

That's why I would like to disable it, UNTIL, it stops trying to cause accidents.

Don't get me wrong, love everything else about the car, but the way it's behaving at the moment (your mileage may vary) is just plain dangerous.",,0,0,0,0

Having a VIN doesn't change anything, the OA still needs confirm details before finalizing the ""paperwork"". They can't do that until they know 100% the car has been staged. 

Obviously ordering a car online experience is a bit different than ordering a USB stick off amazon. I think we are so entitled with the ability to know exactly when a item is and it's status if it's not where it's suppose to be.

Robinhood requires 25K in the account to day trade.
Limit is 3 same day buy/sells in 5 days otherwise.
More likely HODLers hoping to get back to zero along with folks jumping in at the new low prices.
""

That's FINRA rules, not Robinhood's.

Essentially, what's happening is... Robinhood accounts default to margin accounts (because the instant deposits feature counts as margin, even though it's money you have that just hasn't settled yet). FINRA has those requirements for margin accounts because brokers don't want to assume the risk of people day trading on margin.

I wonder if the requirement would be lifted if you contacted Robinhood and requested that all margin be disabled for your account - as soon as you don't have margin of any kind, the FINRA rules aren't in play, and the reason for them isn't in play.

However, the discussion was of swing trading in contrast to buy and hold, and swing trading isn't necessarily day trading. For instance, I might see the prices right now as really interesting on the fundamentals, and see it as a way to make a quick buck whenever it breaks out. My investment horizon would be longer than the same day and therefore the pattern day trading rules wouldn't come into play, but it couldn't be called long-term.

I drove a stretch of highway today that is 55mph. My SR+ identified the correct speed limit, but wouldn't allow me to go over the limit even though I have autopilot set to +5.

Page 74:
“Autosteer is intended for use only by a fully attentive driver on freeways and highways where access is limited by entry and exit ramps. If you choose to use Autosteer on residential roads, a road without a center divider, or a road where access is not limited, Autosteer may limit the maximum allowed cruising speed. The maximum allowed cruising speed on such roads is calculated based on the detected speed limit including a Speed Assist offset of up to +5 mph (10 km/h). Any Speed Assist offset above +5 mph (10 km/h) is rounded down to +5 mph (10 km/h). However, you can select a more restrictive cruising speed by reducing the speed limit offset (see Controlling Speed Assist on page 89) or by changing the set speed (see Changing the Set Speed on page 69).
In situations where the speed limit cannot be detected when Autosteer is engaged, Autosteer reduces your driving speed and limits the set speed to 45 mph (70 km/h). Although you can manually accelerate to exceed the limited speed, Model 3 may not brake for detected obstacles. Autosteer will slow down to the limited speed when you release the accelerator pedal. When you leave the road, or disengage Autosteer by using the steering wheel, you can increase your set speed again, if desired.”",,0,0,0,0

hi,

When making calls in the model 3, the call is interrupted after about one minute. iPhone X displays “call failed”. When I call again the same thing will happen after about one minute. When I do a soft reboot (both scroll wheels) it will work for the rest of the ride. The problem is back in the next ride.
Is there a solution for this problem without having to do a soft reboot every time I get in the car?

Why will the Model Y not ship until 2021? 
I thought it was supposed to be made on the same production line as M3, use the same battery pack and motors, etc etc. 
Not necessarily bashing Tesla here, but what would be the reasons for such a long delay 
for what was supposed to be a ""modular"" change (new body, not new systems).
""

I had the same question thinking how the MINI exists in many body variations. 
I believe they are produced mostly in the same factory, in Oxford, UK and Austria.
See the following: Convertible, 3 & 5 Door Hatch, Countryman and Clubman

 

I just think that for the Fremont Tesla factory, 
there is not enough space to create a new line for the stamping of the Model Y structure and body panels.

Otherwise, the Model 3 and Model Y could certainly share the same assembly line, 
however the Model 3 seems to be reaching a capacity limit. 

I imagine that the Model Y will affect certainly the Model 3 sales, but overall the combined production 
of the Model 3 and Model Y could be about twice the current Model 3 production.

So it seems that the Model Y will be built in a new factory, presumably at the Giga 1 factory?",,0,0,0,0

If they have a Revision C of the display, is that the revision that does not yellow?
""

I do realize that. It makes me sick but I did want it fixed, and I have absolutely NO faith in the ""magical"" solutions proposed. It was this, or yellow screen. Hats off to the people who are waiting. I suggest we do not get quiet about this, even with the fanboys saying we should.

The screen they took out of my December 2018 Model S 75D was:

Tesla PN (TPN): 1078118-00-D (Revision D, but different part number)
Manufacturer part number: G170J1-LE1 (Innolux), Mfr Revision: C3.

The replacement screen was:

Tesla PN (TPN): 1084333-00-C (Revision C, but previously this part number had Revisions A and B.)
Manufacturer part number: DJ170MP-01B (Unknown mfr), Mfr revision: C5

""Pick date"" was 5/18/2019. It was tagged as destined for another vehicle, probably when they were going to do them for free.

So, ""Revision C vs D"" isn't clear cut. It's a completely different part number both from Tesla's standpoint AND the manufacturer's standpoint. The Innolux G170J1-LE1 is out there in the wild and known to be one of the former screen types. I cannot find any references in the wild to the DJ170MP-01B. (I'm assuming in both cases the 170 means 17.0 inches.) - Unknown also if this is another Innolux part.

So it certainly was not replaced with the same screen, and appears to be a later revision. (108xxxx-C vs 107xxxx-D; MFR rev C5 vs C3.)

I was told by three service center managers and three technicians that this is supposed to be the screen that Tesla's engineers ""believe does not have the yellowing issue"". 

Visually, besides the yellowing, there is no difference.

Although Elon Musk said if you bought FSD, you'll get a computer swap to HW3.0 from any hardware from 2.0 and up.

However, contrary to conventional assumption, for used cars: Only HW2.5 are eligible for FSD and no HW2.0 is eligible for FSD. This has been announced before so what you heard is not new:

Was just told that AP 2.0 won't get FSD.

HW2.5 started in Model 3 production since 7/2017

and in Model S and X since 8/23/2017 (some still got HW2.0 for production prior to 8/22/2017.) So, to be sure, I would look at the driver's door sill label with the production month and year starting from September 2017 and later.



Of course, as Elon Musk said any from 2.0 and up!

But he didn't say it's for grandfathered owners only nor did he say it's for used cars also.

It's a generic statement.

IMO the reason is because the car can pull power from the outlet rather than discharge cycling the pack.

Is this true? In my experience it discharges the pack and then recharges it...but maybe the behavior has changed?

In general I would keep the pack between 50% and 90% as much as you can since that is what Tesla enforces if you follow their instructions to “LEAVE YOUR VEHICLE PLUGGED IN when you are not using it.” (Page 122). Note that you can have it plugged in and set the charge limit low (minimum is 50%) if that is preferable for any reason (like free charging elsewhere). That obeys the spirit of Tesla’s recommendations (and they will force you to charge to 50% if you do this). 

In context, they want you to keep the car plugged in, because it guarantees it will keep a minimum of ~50% state of charge.",,0,0,0,0

No need to make a smaller pack version (which would also cut range), Tesla can instead add a super-chill mode, or you run in valet or teen driver mode to reduce max performance.
The majority of the cost is in the low volume production and development (and halo). Dropping to a 100kWh pack would only shave ~ 12k off the price (ignoring R&D). Even dropping the front motor and creating a new single motor rear drive unit would not get you $50k off.
Resale on a nerfed Roadster would not be good either...
""

I think this is the best answer. It's doubtful Tesla will come out with a neutered version of the roadster, since it's meant to be a low-volume, max power vehicle. If you'd just want the looks of one, make a kit car.

208/120 is typically used for receptacles and lighting. 230v 3 phase is a common industrial voltage used for heavier loads like larger motors. When I said the transformer was 480/230 I meant it was as step down transformer (from 480 to 230, three phase). The EVSE is connected to two legs of the 230 three phase.
""

Hrm, I am not aware of this voltage configuration. There is a configuration called ""High-leg Delta"" where each of the phases is 240v from each other (so used for three phase 240v motors), and then one of the phase pairs are center tapped to neutral which gives you the ability to have 120v from neutral to those two hot conductors. Then the third phase has 240v to each of the other phases, but 208v to the neutral. It is a voltage configuration that allows the power company to deliver three phase service with only two transformers and to provide both 120v and 240v and 240v three phase.

If this is the type of service your work has then the question is how did they hook up the EVSE? Generally you would not do a single phase breaker from the ""high leg"" (aka 208v leg) to neutral (the breakers are not very common for one thing). Then I know the Tesla Wall Connector says *not* to use the 240v phase pairs that are not center tapped. You are only supposed to use the center tapped pair of phases. I do not know if this applies to other EVSE's as well.

I wonder if this has something to do with your issue...

Also, 230v is not a thing here in the US as far as I know. As described above, nominal is 240v. Other common voltages are 120v, 208v, 277v, and 480v.",,0,0,0,0

I did a trip from So Cal to Utah and back with the family. I spent days with a better route planner trying to make it work. In the end, I took the ICE. Good decision, but upon reaching destination one in Zion, I looked longingly at the Tesla destination charger, but had to reconcile that it would have taken 3 to 4 Supercharger stops to get there. Destination two was an Airbnb, and I found that it had an electric dryer in the garage so I could have charged there, so I felt regret not taking the Tesla.

Here's my read on the situation. The actual Joanne Orencia lost her badge or someone was able to take a picture of it. This person has been posting under her name about the low production numbers (maybe old photos) and also did the toilet paper leak to Fred. That person is badmouthing Tesla talking about how terrible a working environment it is. This is also why this person keeps posting and asking people to follow them on Twitter. 

Either that, or I'm completely wrong and it's a disgruntled employee that is not respecting an NDA and wants attention by constantly posting on Twitter and asking for people to follow her and wants to do harm to the company. In which case we aren't sure if the production numbers are for one shift or the entire day. 

Either way should and will be brought to the attention of Tesla.

Tesla always touts their philosophy “safety first”. They state Autopilot makes the cars safer and that is the reason it’s standard. If that is the case then All Tesla’s should receive the update. 

I believe a safety feature that is now standard to be retroactively given to previous models.

This would be like Tesla initially offering antilock brakes as an up charge, software locked. Then realizing that this is a great safety feature making it standard but leaving out the early buyers.

Oil != gas. Someone has to refine it. And as refineries close, supply will shrink.
""

There will likely be reverse economies of scale as demand reduces for gas. Less competition in production, transportation, refining and point of sale. The customer will also likely be significantly disadvantaged as the number of gas stations reduce and they will need to go further out of their way to fill up. There could be a short term drop in price while the large incumbent industry is chasing fewer sales, however as the industry shrinks the price will likely increase.

3700497,Winter tire recommendations,Merle,2019-05-29 00:10:00,"TL;DR: Ordered some Toyo Celsius 245/45-19's for winter tires to swap out the 21 ones on right now for next season. They're mountain and snowflake rated which is what matters the most when trying to pick out a snow tire that works in a variety of conditions. 

Even on summer tires, Pilot Sport AS tires, you can still drive in snow conditions that warrant chains - simply by going slow. 

Around April of this year, I drove from Denver over Vail Pass to Salt Lake city during one of those late season storms. It wasn't so bad over Vail, even though the Colorado folks had the east bound traffic shut down, and just opened the west bound traffic over the pass. Lots of slush, but temperatures were low. 

Heading up Highway 6 to SLC was a bit more tricky, there weren't any lane markings and it was impossible to see the road. I'd estimate about a bit over an inch on the road. Maybe 2-3"" maximum.

I live in Tahoe, 10+ years up Kingsbury Grade (if you know where Heavenly is, I'm up that way across the street near the top) which gets massive amounts of snow, roughly 9' this year with a snow shower as recent as this Memorial Day weekend. We have sections that are 6-9% grades, with several curves that are 180 degrees. 

California does have chain controls, particularly over places like Echo Summit. Took those same tires over the same chain control conditions (late at night, about 2A) to figure out how bad they could. Felt wheel slip about three times, but the light only came on once after I gunned it around Sierra (lots of room to correct) to get the light to come on. 

The point is that nearly any tire, even summer tires, can get you there if you stick to the main roads. Just go slow (10-15MPH) and understand the consequences of failure.

I do get stuck, even with 4WD, locking diffs, GYSA (tires with Mountain and snowflakes) ... twice this year, 10' and 50' going down my street out of the driveway. Even with ""great"" tires, and equipment, it's simply not enough if you screw around too much. I drive not only in the mountains, but down to CA and valleys, so need a tire that can not only handle the snow / ice / slush but also handle the heat.",,0,0,0,0

There is a lot more price elasticity of demand for those other uses for oil.

I'm looking to purchase my first Tesla... I have thought about the Model 3, and it's really nice, but since it's so new, there are very few used ones available. A new one would cost too much, so I was thinking about a used Model S. 

I think I have narrowed it down to a 2016 model S because it's the most recent model that still has unlimited super charging, and is within my budget, but I want to make sure I get one that can do FSD in the future. 

I stopped by a Tesla dealership/store today, and was told by the associate that I needed to get one with the HW2.5, which has the newer front, without the oval ring. 

Can anyone in here shed some light on this for me? Is hardware v2, 2.5, or newer required for FSD? Can the computer be updated by Tesla for FSD?

A lot of griping about ELDA. Has anyone here actually experienced an unsafe ELDA interaction?
""

My guess is that you don't live in the Netherlands (nor Belgium, the land of the really creative human- but not machine readable lane markings).

Yes. 

Areas of concern:
-Two way traffic roads with two bike suggestion lanes, where you need to cross into the bike suggestion lane to cross other vehicles. High grass or a tree close to the roadside is sometimes enough to make ELDA freak out and jerk you into the incoming traffic.
-road works with permanent but stale (white) lane markings and temporary and valid road markings (yellow) that weave in between the stale lane markings. Even Autosteer tends to follow the yellow markings, but sometimes ELDA balks at crossing the stale solid white lines and jerks you into following the now stale lane markings (regardless of what's driving there), sometimes even towards a concrete block (which surely is a less virtual obstacle than a solid line painted on the ground).
-Bus stops painted protruding into the right hand lane. You're supposed to cross these when there is no bus, but there are hatched areas to prevent people parking in front or behind the bus stop that ELDA sees as no-go areas (I guess it sees the bus stop as an ""obstacle"" that it should avoid, but bus stops fortuitously do not cross the road). At one point at one of these bus stops it jerked me to the left and disengaged AutoSteer, leaving the car pointed straight at a lamp post in the median strip.

To be honest: I usually don't wait to see if it will avoid the real obstacle it lobs me towards in order to avoid the virtual obstacle just for the sake of scientific curiosity. Perhaps it would jerk me back to safety avoiding the ""other"" (very real) emergency, but it should have had the foresight not to create that hazard in the first place.

How close (or far) are the feds to legalizing rear view cameras as a complete substitute for outside mirrors? You would have to devote a decent amount of screen area or have a couple of designated screens that would always display what’s behind you from the left and right side.
""

The eTron prototype had screens in the door just below the windows, so they were in the same general area as mirrors. Japan has legalized them, but I haven't heard of any other jurisdiction legalizing them yet. 

New videos show how Audi E-Tron’s new virtual side mirrors work

The slowness of regulators to legalize cameras to replace mirrors is one of the driving reasons that I think even when self driving tech has been proven it's going to take years before many jurisdictions legalizing it. Rear view cameras are minor tech compared to self driving tech. The problems with rear view cameras are drastically fewer and simpler, yet regulators are hesitating to go for it.

This article from 2014 says mirrors create 2% to 7% drag.

Sooooo for everyone with AP2.0 who prepaid for FSD, I wonder what the end game is here?

I can't imagine it ending any better way other than Tesla trying to appease with buybacks or upgrade discounts, or designing a HW3 retrofit kit, whichever options are cheaper.

If the car was sold with a FSD option it's harder for Tesla to dismiss arguments that this is specifically why the customer chose to buy that car.
""

Tesla sold AP2.0 as FSD capable, just like they sold P85D's as 691hp capable. Yes, it took them a couple of years to finally admit that capable doesn't mean it will ever be actually doing it (in case of P85D they finally admitted after a lawsuit that 463hp is what the actual power produced by the motors is). AP2.0 FSD will end the same way, except any lawsuit will have much harder time succeeding because of the fine print they were smart to add since day one of FSD - nobody can predict when this will become available.

Pv=I^2((l x rho)/a) = 16x16x((25 x 0,0175) / 2,5) = 44,8W x 3 = 134,4W
Pv=I^2((l x rho)/a) = 16x16x((25 x 0,0175) / 4) = 28W x 3 = 84W
Pv=I^2((l x rho)/a) = 16x16x((25 x 0,0175) / 6) = 18,6W x 3 = 55,8W

Mijn laadtijd is hooguit 6 uur dus ik verlies op 25m kabel 2.5mm2 6*134,4=806,4Wh = 17 eurocent
Met 6mm2 kabel is het verlies 6 * 55,8W = 334,8Wh = 7 eurocent

Spanningsval kan een reden zijn om dikker te gaan, maar de val over 25m is 
Uv=I x ((l x rho) / a) = 16 x ((25 x 0,0175) / 2,5) = 2,8V in het slechtste geval, en

Aangezien die 25m kabel niet op een bosje ligt maar in de vrije lucht hangt of is ingegraven is koeling ook niet echt een issue, de kabel zal niet warm worden bij een verlies van 134W over 25m kabel...

De argumenten om 4mm te doen is als je 3 fase meer dan 11kW wil gaan laden, of als je 1 fase meer dan 3,6kW wil gaan laden, of als je kabellengte's hebt die ruim boven de 25m uitkomen. Of als je paranoia bent natuurlijk",,0,0,0,0

- Raam is over de chromen lijst heem geschoven waardoor schade.
- achterklep kieren die niet gelijk zijn. En wat er lelijk uitziet.

My ownership advisor told me to hold off on the payment section, but then after a three week wait had me complete it and I got a VIN match shortly after.
""

Yup, everything completed the same day. A month and no VIN. There have been a number of posts by folks who are being told by their delivery reps that Tesla is no longer producing on demand, but rather mass producing then matching production to orders.

Unfortunately for those of us buying M X, if true this turns into the proverbial lottery. Tesla has reduced staff, and reduced M X factory runs by 1/2 by ending the evening shift. Elon also stated that their main focus is on the M 3. Such an approach would explain why deliveries on the spreadsheet are no where close to sequential.

On the upside my Delivery rep did report that she could see my order was in production - but that there was still no vin match. This phrasing could support, or counter either production theory. The down side is that I read (from last year while the M X production line was running dual shifts) that it took 9 days to produce an X. With that down to 1 shift does this mean I am still 3 weeks out?

Norway is a special case. 100% taxes on new ICE purchase distorted both the new and used markets. So a $50k car that's $100k new might be 60k after 3 years. But who will buy a 3 year old ICE for 60k when a new Model 3 costs 50k?

You really can't apply that to other markets, where that same ICE is 30k after 3 years.
""




Lycanthrope said:

You're seeing it all wrong.

Zero-emission cars are getting subsidies in Norway, polluting cars are being taxed.

In a world that desperately needs to reverse CO2 and NO emissions, these punitive taxes should be applied to all ICE vehicle in every state and country, immediately IMO.

The revenue should be spent on renewables.

It's only with this type of change that we'll start to turn things around.
""

Also note that if these estimates are correct then the ICE taxes in Norway are not punitive, they simply charge the true cost of an ICE car, which is more than the car's purchase price:



Fact Checking said:
↑

Fair enough, let me back up this claim I made:

""Secondly, an ICE car does around $50k damage to health and environment during its lifetime, so there's nothing 'punitive' about taxing them much higher. In fact the equal treatment of ICE cars in many other countries is a hidden subsidy.""​
I'm basing this figure on the following study from 2015:

""The social cost of atmospheric release""
​If we only try to estimate the economic effect of 3.2 million premature deaths per year which are directly related to vehicle tailpipe emissions, the study comes up with a per gallon of gasoline damage figure:

""Illustrative calculations indicate environmental damages are $330-970 billion yr−1 for current US electricity generation (~14–34¢ per kWh for coal, ~4–18¢ for gas) and $3.80 (−1.80/+2.10) per gallon of gasoline ($4.80 (−3.10/+3.50) per gallon for diesel).""

""These results suggest that total atmosphere-related environmental damages plus generation costs are much greater for coal-fired power than other types of electricity generation, and that damages associated with gasoline vehicles substantially exceed those for electric vehicles.""​
From $3.80-$4.80 per gallon damages figure we can estimate average per ICE vehicle lifetime damages:

Average mileage per year is around ~13,400 miles in the U.S.:
Average Annual Miles per Driver by Age Group

Average fuel consumption per mile driven was around 25 miles per gallon in 2018:
U.S. vehicle fuel economy rises to record 24.7 mpg: EPA | Reuters

Average vehicle lifespan is around 15 years in the U.S.:
Average Lifespan for U.S. Vehicles – Berla.co

The rest can be derived from these figures:
Average life time mileage of a car is 15*13,400 = 201,000 miles
Average fuel consumption is 201,000/25 = 8,040 gallons of fuel
Average life time direct health cost of:
of gasoline cars: 8,040*3.80 = ~$30,500
of diesel cars: 8,040*4.80 = ~$38,500


But note that the figures in this 2015 study are conservative, in particular the $3.80-$4.80 per gallon of fuel health damage figure is based on a global average of health costs of:

""Climate-health calculations therefore use a Value of a Statistical Life (VSL) of $1.7 million (for 2010), which is the nominal US-based VSL of $7.5 million adjusted to account for carbonaceous aerosol exposure- and population-weighted country-specific income differences from prior analyses (UNEP 2011).""​
That's polite formulation for: ""third world people are 4.4x cheaper for the ICE industry to kill.""

If we correct for that factor and price the 'cost of life' in the U.S., we get 7.5/1.7*3.80 = $16.7 per gallon health damage caused by gasoline vehicles, and $21.1 for diesel vehicles, which correct the life time damage figures upwards significantly:

average estimated life time health damage caused by gasoline cars with U.S. pricing = ~$134,000
average life time health damage caused by diesel cars with U.S. pricing = ~$170,000
But it gets even worse for the ICE industry, the ""premature deaths"" related to air pollution do not include other ICE emissions related damage, such as:

The already ongoing damage and harm from global warming, such as the 200 billion dollars Hurricane Harvey, which hurricane and rainfall was very probably amplified by global warming into a catastrophic event:
Global Warming Tied to Hurricane Harvey [Scientific American]
The direct Hurricane Harvey damages alone would wipe out all ICE industry profits for the last 2 years. ('Triple damages' and RICO punitive damages due to being part of a criminal conspiracy such as the Dieselgate criminal conspiracy would probably wipe out the ICE profits for the last 10 years, for Hurricane Harvey alone.)

Nor does it include the economic damage caused by rising sea levels that are going to destroy, for example, a significant percentage of current Florida coastal real estate value over the next 30-50 years.
There's ongoing damage to real estate exposed to vehicle tailpipe emissions in urban environments, with very high depreciation and maintenance costs:
""Studies on the effects of air pollution on limestone degradation in Great Britain""

The 2015 study cites a global ""3.2 million premature deaths per year"" from pollution alone, which @ReflexFunds recently argued convincingly (with citations) is probably significantly higher in reality, and also in large part caused by ICE vehicles.
None of these costs are included in the estimates above.

That's wrong (see the citations above), and my cautious $50k figure is probably on the lower end of the real costs.

TL;DR: the real per ICE vehicle life time health and environmental damage cost could be several times $50k if we include all these external costs. Most ICE cars do health and environmental damage that are literally several times the value of the car, and even the high ICE taxes in Norway probably don't cover those damages.
""

I.e.:

average estimated life time health damage caused by gasoline cars with U.S. pricing = ~$134,000
average life time health damage caused by diesel cars with U.S. pricing = ~$170,000

Which means that for Norway it's common sense to severely restrict and then ban ICE cars, just like it's common-sense to charge more for radioactive fuel, to cover the rod removal and safe long term nuclear waste storage costs - which clean-up costs wind and solar energy does not have.

Except that for ICE cars the waste is currently emitted straight into the atmosphere, ""for free"", in a free-loading fashion, causing various sorts of damage - hence the mis-pricing.

There's no more freeloading for the ICE industry in Norway.",,0,0,0,0

My take on the China Model 3 price announcement is that this is a good sign that demand is strong. If demand was low I find it hard to believe Tesla would announce the pricing as it is all but certain going to reduce the number of orders placed from China for the rest of Q2/Q3.
""

I hope that's the case, but unfortunately there is another possible explanation: Chinese sales could be much worse than expected at the moment, and so they might have concluded that they can bring in more cash from pre-orders than continued poor sales.
Yet another explanation is that Tesla may be hoping for orders from people who are waiting for full pricing information before ordering, i.e. a lot of people in China may be waiting to see how much the locally-produced SR+ is going to cost before deciding which version to order.

Concerning that some reps are saying PCP isn’t coming..

And some are saying it'll be this week, and some are saying a couple of weeks.

The only people that really know will be a few people at Tesla and Blackhorse, and they're not telling. Reps making stuff up is just muddying the waters.

Anyway, another 3rd party PCP quote cropped up.. this one is a wierd one, as it's for 2 years, but the company apparently will do more ordinary PCP deals if you ask them.

More details on the facebook forum.. but I think we'll be well served for 3rd party PCP should Tesla not come through.

3700695,Does FW 2019.16.2 sentry mode record on AP 2.0,Yinn,2019-05-29 03:55:00,"BigD0g said:
↑

Completely agree! But for sake of clarity it just doesn't exist with AP 2.0. And as of 16.2 still doesn't, and who knows if they will enable it vs this false sense of security they give now making owners ""think"" it's actually doing something.
""

Valid. It’s a fancy UI to an existing alarm system if you will. Although the alarm system was enhanced with pre-trigger warnings. I think they should make a distinction between sentry mode, and the ability to record/dash cam. Yet another communication problem..

Everyone with AP2+ will get Sentry Mode. Which will include geo based arming. The ability to pre-arm the alarm system and provide an extended perimeter with visual monitoring in addition to the existing shock and use monitoring.

For those with recording capabilities, (AP2.5+) Sentry mode will also be able to trigger and utilize existing dash cam features.",,0,0,0,0

I have been surprised by a local reduction in gas pumps already, and we are not an EV-friendly community. Our local Circle K dug up the parking lot maybe 6 months ago or more, to replace 4 gas pumps with 2. Quite surprised to see that, maybe this is a corner case because they make more on the cupcakes and beer in the store than they do on gas, or maybe some strategic move company-wide. Can’t find anything on the web about it.

Not quite. No subsidies. Only lack of various taxes. Originally cars were taxed as luxury items here based on price and engine size. And heavily taxed - in Sweden cars cost only half of this. 

A while back the car taxes started changing gradually - and now they are based on engine pollution. So no taxes for electric cars. And less taxes for hybrids.

The eTron prototype had screens in the door just below the windows, so they were in the same general area as mirrors. Japan has legalized them, but I haven't heard of any other jurisdiction legalizing them yet. 

New videos show how Audi E-Tron’s new virtual side mirrors work

The slowness of regulators to legalize cameras to replace mirrors is one of the driving reasons that I think even when self driving tech has been proven it's going to take years before many jurisdictions legalizing it. Rear view cameras are minor tech compared to self driving tech. The problems with rear view cameras are drastically fewer and simpler, yet regulators are hesitating to go for it.

Also note that if the estimates quoted below are correct, then the ICE taxes in Norway are not punitive, they simply charge the true cost of an ICE car, which is more than the car's purchase price:



I.e.:

average estimated life time health damage caused by gasoline cars with U.S. pricing = ~$134,000
average life time health damage caused by diesel cars with U.S. pricing = ~$170,000

Which means that for Norway it's common sense to severely restrict and then ban ICE cars, just like it's common-sense to charge more for radioactive fuel, to cover the rod removal and safe long term nuclear waste storage costs - which clean-up costs wind and solar energy does not have.

Except that for ICE cars the waste is currently emitted straight into the atmosphere, ""for free"", in a free-loading fashion, causing various sorts of damage - hence the mis-pricing.

There's no more freeloading for the ICE industry in Norway.

I hope that's the case, but unfortunately there is another possible explanation: Chinese sales could be much worse than expected at the moment, and so they might have concluded that they can bring in more cash from pre-orders than continued poor sales.
Yet another explanation is that Tesla may be hoping for orders from people who are waiting for full pricing information before ordering, i.e. a lot of people in China may be waiting to see how much the locally-produced SR+ is going to cost before deciding which version to order. Some of these people may end up purchasing higher trims or even S/X.

Or there could be some other very different reason - e.g. concerns about people ordering from the competition if Tesla doesn't open orders soon, or even the hope of generating a very large number of pre-orders to help to support the share price by destroying the narrative that Tesla's demand has collapsed.
""

Yes, exactly, and I'd also add that:

such events will expand brand awareness and build organic demand,
plus all these factors of motivation are not exclusive and it's very likely a combination of all these factors that Tesla China used as a justification for this event.
My guess is that the main motivation is to bring clarity and stop the Osborning of current Tesla sales in China by a future product with an unknown but likely significantly lower price. I.e. the current situation is the perfect Osborn Effect setup for China sales to be hurt by the expected Shanghai SR+ production which begins ""in a couple of months"".

By announcing the price Tesla China can bring pricing and feature set clarity - which might push quite a few customers over the fence to order one of the currently available products made in the U.S.A.",,0,0,0,0

Anyone know if i need to get it removed to get the Headlight replaced?
Im pretty sure they wraped the bumper around the edges, so it shouldn't require removal for the bumper to come off.

They don't remove the bumper. All the work is done from within the frunk. Actually, they remove the frunk and then replace the entire module. It's the size of a shoebox.

And, the tech (fwiw) said that this is an ongoing issue. So, it isn't a bad batch of assemblies they got 3 years ago and are working their way out of.

I’ve never heard that. Was it here on this forum you read that. Was that fact, or speculation ?
""

I don't know how the 3 system architecture is set up, or if there have been changes to the S/X system, especially with the new Raven cars.

The original dual motor S sent the accelerator position data directly to the rear motor power electronics, which then decided how much power the rear motor would provide and how much the front would.

Failures in the rear drive unit power electronics (more common than failures of the mechanical parts) would thus be likely to stop the car, depending on exactly what broke - or so the forum discussion went four years ago.

In practice, drive unit failures on the dual motor cars were pretty rare so we didn't really get a useful statistical sample of test cases, though as I recall most of them were side of the road events - I think the main discussion started just like this, with a car that was stuck on the side of the road and folks asking why the front drive unit couldn't carry on.",,0,0,0,0

3700755,Need your feedback on the used 2012 Honda CR-V EX-L,jeanamstertadt,2019-05-29 04:46:00,"What is your opinion on the 2012 Honda CR-V EX-L? Its market value ranges between $13,000 and $17,000, which is pricey but I think is deserving for an easy-to-drive compact SUV with a stylish exterior and roomy interior, as shown in the video below:



The vehicle is available in five trims: the base LX, the EX, the EXL with navigation, and the touring trim. These trims are installed either as front-wheel or all-wheel drive

The all-wheel-drive CR-V can endure snow and other nasty conditions. Its system can sense a loss of traction and automatically transfer power to the rear wheels which helps you stay on course.

It is equipped with Honda's sensing suite of safety and driver technologies

Also, the vehicle is equipped with a standard back camera that provides a motion picture on the vehicle's rear and other nearby objects. It can be adjusted based on three angles: overhead, normal and wide view

As for the engine, its 2.4-liter, 4-cylinder engine is capable of providing 185 horsepower, which helps the vehicle's Continuously Variable Transmission perform well in the case of automatic transmission

In the interior, the vehicle features a 7-inch, touchscreen display for audio, information, connectivity, navigation, radio, phone calls, live video and entertainment. Its steering wheel is mounted with control buttons and Bluetooth hands-free link.

For the seats, they can be adjusted to provide more space for the passengers as well as the cargo. A total of 70.9 cubic feet of cargo space can be achieved if the rear seats are pulled down. Without folding down the rear seats, the vehicle can carry a maximum of 5 passengers while providing 35.2 cubic ft of space for cargo

The speed of 60 miles per hour can be achieved from zero in just 8.8 seconds. From a rate of 50 miles per hour, an additional 20 miles per hour can be added in under 4.5 seconds

For fuel economy, it is usually 26 miles per gallon in the city and 33 miles per gallon on highways. The vehicle can carry a maximum of 15.3 gallons of fuel tank, which can take you as far as 450 miles before depletion.

Having said all this, I am considering buying a used one but I wanna know your opinions first before making a purchase.",,0,0,0,0

I'm looking to purchase my first Tesla... I have thought about the Model 3, and it's really nice, but since it's so new, there are very few used ones available. A new one would cost too much, so I was thinking about a used Model S. 

I think I have narrowed it down to a 2016 model S because it's the most recent model that still has unlimited super charging, and is within my budget, but I want to make sure I get one that can do FSD in the future. 

I stopped by a Tesla dealership/store today, and was told by the associate that I needed to get one with the HW2.5, which has the newer front, without the oval ring. 

Can anyone in here shed some light on this for me? Is hardware v2, 2.5, or newer required for FSD? Can the computer be updated by Tesla for FSD? 

Anything else I should consider when purchasing a used Model S? 

Thank you.
""

If it were me, and budget were an issue, I wouldn't worry so much about FSD. I have HW 2.5. I don't have the latest ""summon"" but I find that the other 2 signature features - autoparking, and NoA, aren't particularly useful. Autoparking... meh. It works pretty well, but it's slow to the point where I feel a little goofy using it. And NoA is very much a work in progress, and not really usable. In heavy traffic it struggles to change lanes when it needs to because it's too conservative. And in medium traffic, it changes lanes when it shouldn't. For example, it will change to the fast lane to overtake, even when a much faster car is coming up, just out of range of the cameras. I don't see that that will be an easy problem to solve, since the cameras just can't see back back far enough, and the system lacks contextual awareness.

For lane following and ACC, the AP 1.0, in my prior 2014, is every bit as good as it is in my 2018 AP 2.5. Really with a late AP1.0 car, the only thing that I think I would miss is the newer MCU, which is definitely faster and smoother.

I would be looking for the best quality, lowest mileage, best optioned 100D or P100D AP1.0 that I could find. I suspect you can get pretty deals on those right now.",,0,0,0,0

NO pre-delivery prep. Car was FILTHY inside and out. White GLOP in the seams. PLASTIC WRAP still on steering wheel. STICKERS on the seats. Spent $200 after delivery to have it detailed. Within two days after delivery, charge port and on-board charger failed and had to be replaced. Nearest service center is 250 miles away, so repairs as a result of the charge system failure were were inconvenient and lengthy. That was last October. Since then, the car has been fine and we love the driving experience, but the early negative delivery experience coupled with the hardware failures will leave a lasting impression. I had a similar experience in 1970 with an American brand. I drove other brands for the next 30 years. Tesla must fix these problems now or there will be few new and repeat customers in the future, and that would be a tragedy.

I hope that's the case, but unfortunately there is another possible explanation: Chinese sales could be much worse than expected at the moment, and so they might have concluded that they can bring in more cash from pre-orders than continued poor sales.
Yet another explanation is that Tesla may be hoping for orders from people who are waiting for full pricing information before ordering, i.e. a lot of people in China may be waiting to see how much the locally-produced SR+ is going to cost before deciding which version to order. Some of these people may end up purchasing higher trims or even S/X.

Or there could be some other very different reason - e.g. concerns about people ordering from the competition if Tesla doesn't open orders soon, or even the hope of generating a very large number of pre-orders to help to support the share price by destroying the narrative that Tesla's demand has collapsed.

If you were in China right now why on earth would you order a Model 3 now? In a few weeks you can order one for significantly less money. Of course the Chinese numbers are low.

Hi everyone

We (my girlfriend and I) are from Switzerland and we will be on a 7 month trip around the US from Oct 1st 2019 till Apr 30th 2020, start and end in Miami, FL, and we would be interested in buying a used Tesla as cheap as possible (probably high milage, older model). We already have some offers in sight, such as a 2013 Model S 85 for slightly under $30'000.

We wondered, if someone here is selling a Tesla even cheaper and would be happy to make a decent offer for a Tesla that's maybe hard to sell due to high milage or a few non-significant scratches. However, the car should be considered to be ready to do a 15'000 miles trip without any major initial repairs or maintenance.

Must have:

Selling price under $30'000
250+ miles of range on 100% charge
Turn-by-Turn navigation (former ""tech package"")
Warranty at least until May 2020 / 20k miles
Delivery to Miami FL on Oct 1st 2019 (if not situated nearby, please state est. delivery costs)

Nice to have:

Free Supercharging
Autopilot
Possibility to sell back the car at the end of the trip to initial seller (or ship to Europe for own use or sell to Tesla)

We could offer a full cash payment (online banking) at delivery. Even if you're not selling a Tesla with these specs yourself, we would be very thankful for any advice.

Thanks for your help

Not sure what new features you would expect for a 5 year old car. May have reached the limitation of processing power for the onboard computer. Kind of like a 5 year old iPhone.
""

The ""processing power"" on the cars is the same from 2012 up through March 2018 and doesn't really enter into it. I would say that any features generic to the car, and not associated with AP or the cameras (sentry mode, etc) would still be supported and distributed to early non-AP cars. 

By the way, Apple is still selling, supporting, and updating new iPhone 6 units which were released in 2014 (5 years ago).",,0,0,0,0

There’s a good chance that you will destroy your MXM4s in a single day if you drive close to the limit. I believe @SammichLover can show you pictures. Seems like a waste of $1k to me. I think it’s worth it to get appropriate tires (Hankook R-S4 are my recommendation) mounted on dedicated rims.
""

Yes.


In some ways this picture doesn't tell the proper story. The problem I think is to keep from rolling and popping them you over-inflate (and dear god, check pressure between runs as the front will rise 1PSI or more a run) and that means you are eating the center tread even faster than at the factory pressure.

And they smelled worse. It was the smell that told me I'd kill them. 

If there is a reasonable chance you'll keep doing this, but you're not entirely sure, you can do what I did after the above oopsie. Get some bargin 200tw to 300tw tires on their own bargin rims. No need for TPMS. $1250 at Tirerack got me the whole set, and with careful rotation (front is much harder on the tires) I've gotten 8 events plus 2 track days out of them so far. Only down to the tip of the wear bars now, lots left. I actually have them for sale for the price of the rims, and if they sell I'll be going to RE71R on 18"" that'll support larger rotor kits in case that's what I do with the brakes (need that for track, not AX).",,0,0,0,0

Lots of e-trons in Europe with video mirrors. Probably around 1000 already in Norway. Quite expensive option so but sure what the take rate will be.

If Tesla also make video mirrors they should make a brighter and bigger screen than the e-tron has, and consider a different position. I guess Tesla will not as long as their home market is not available yet for this tech.
""

The Model X prototype had cameras, but they had to put mirrors on the production cars because US laws are byzantine and strict about physical mirrors and nobody had really done anything to change them. Tesla sells at least 1/2 their cars in the US, so they probably won't have a camera system on production cars until the laws change. 

It's probable that 51 laws need to change in the US. Most states have mirror laws and there is a federal law about mirrors. The feds could do a universal law that overrides all state laws, but some yahoos who like mirrors will probably sue over their state's rights being taken away and the whole thing will take another couple of years to sort out in the courts.",,0,0,0,0

Wat voor concessies dan?
""

Zie bijvoorbeeld de post van de frunk hiervoor .

Andere concessies:
- de stroomlijn van de SUV met een 80 kWh batterij is niet het juiste recept voor 400km range
- De motor voor hangt in een krat i.p.v. gemonteerd in het geheel. Ze brengen het als een voordeel wat betreft geluid, maar wat zijn de nadelen? Als die er zijn .

- Het is op dezelfde band als de benzine variant
- kofferruimte...?

You have the (somewhat dubious) privilege of being the first case of a dead model 3 drive unit I've read about.

Of course, that means we wrong have any ideas what's wrong until Tesla tells you.

They probably haven't seen it before, either - that's why they want to keep the car for a bit I bet.

Replacing a drive unit is much, much easier than replacing an engine in a typical car, should only take them a couple hours - once they have a replacement ready for your car, but since this hasn't really been happening I doubt the service center has spares in inventory.

Has anyone seen close to 150 kW with a MR? I pulled into a 150 kW capable charger after driving about 4 hours with 5% state of charge remaining and saw a spike to 125 kW, but sustained 121 kW for a while. The navigation system was routing me to the supercharger, so I assume it was using the intelligent warm up feature. I was running firmware 2019.12.1.2.
""

A plateau at 121 kW is consistent with what @JuiceBx recorded and I plotted here: 150kW Supercharging for Model 3

This is the same c-rate as the LR cars experience at 150 kW, assuming 37 cells per brick in the MR battery and 46 in the LR. 

Anyone on 19.15.11 might see higher than 121kW though as it appears to include a test profile for V3 Superchargers. It might go up to 150kW in the MR.",,0,0,0,0

No one was in the drivers seat. Neighbors ran over and couldn't get the car to stop or reverse.

She had to prematurely deliver her child through a broken pelvic bone.

When I asked at Salisbury and they told me about the equipment delay, they told me the plan is to have all the hardware for both Salisbury and Woodstock show up in June together, then they'd come together really quickly as all the hard work is already done on both of them. I had suggested August for both of them, and the response was that no way it would take that long.
Now that it looks like Quispamsis is ahead of Woodstock on construction, and Salisbury was really fast to ""ready for hardware"" stage from the way it looks at Quispam right now, it seems like they'll have all of them done as nicely as Salisbury before the hardware arrives. So if it takes a week to wire one up, and the hardware is say mid June, best guess would be to have the tech down early July to light up all three (and then maybe Baileyville and Medway??)

This is big. Norway gives us a sneak peak into the used car market, x years from now, where x is the number of years your local market lags Norway in EV adoption.

As people grok this, the new ICE market collapses, people will buy EV or used ICEV only. Stock prices in ICEV makers collapses. Their window of opportunity to go electric while solvent shortens.

Warn your friends on facebook that now is a bad time to buy an ICEV if they hope to have any resale. If they take out a lease, make sure it's one where they don't end up forced to pay the residual. Let the leasing company wear it (assuming the leasing company survives).

And, yes, I am salty about having paid $3k for FSD in 2017 that hasn’t had a single feature release, then watching Tesla lower the price for others later. Tesla still hasn’t delivered anything yet after over a year and I can’t get a refund either.

There's a long thread on it: Emergency Lane Departure - False Positives

It may depend on what types of roads you drive. I imagine it's good/useful on highways.

And these false positives can be dangerous; not only is it scary to have the car beep loudly and jerk the wheel all of a sudden, it can jerk the wheel towards oncoming bidirectional traffic to avoid the non-emergency in the shoulder.

First off, I love my M3dm, best car I’ve ever owned. We gave a deposit within 24hrs of the unveiling of the M3, waited 2+ yrs for it. We financially reached for the dual motor as we were originally planning on buying the standard M3 but at the time it looked like it was going to be an even longer wait and the dual motor just became available that June.

We paid Tesla 54k , no autopilot, black, this is the peak retail of what customers paid for a M3dm to Tesla. Today every M3 is sold w/autopilot standard (except supposedly the standard) for safety reasons and for less. And yet the early adopters of the M3 have not received an update activating the new version of Autopilot to the early M3 owners.

I’m mad in the fact this group is being overlooked/ignored by Tesla. We gave deposits on good faith, helped Tesla get these cars into production. I tried to call my advisor in Las Vegas and couldn’t get through. Relayed my frustration to my local dealer in Dedham MA. I was told the message would be relayed to the general manager. I have yet to receive a follow up call.

Am I wrong? Do other owners feel the same way? Sorry for the long post.

""

I apologize if it came out that way, when I made that post I was really frustrated - I put down a deposit and arranged the pickup of the car solely based on what Tesla was telling me on their used page for my car, but then I read about the battery problems and performance P90DL's have and felt extremely misled and extremely stupid (the two go hand in hand). 

From what I've been seeing, P90DL's can have a lot of different battery versions, each with its own capabilities, and earlier V1 batteries are much closer to P85D's than P100DL's, but the Tesla used page lists them all as having the performance of the best possible battery. I'm not saying Tesla should have taken my car to the track to measure things, but they do know which battery it has, at least they could have tried to be more truthful and less misleading by grouping P90D's by battery version before issuing performance numbers.

Same thing with range. This is a 4 year old car, especially with the possible range degradation issues specific to 90kWh cars, it could have significantly lowered range. And yet Tesla is not telling me what the range is even though they so easily could. It's like reporting mileage - you can just literally look in the car and publish the range numbers for every specific car that way. How is telling me the car has 270 miles of range (which it's guaranteed to not have) (even though they could tell me the right one so easily) doing the right thing?

I'm with you - I don't want any feature where the car take controls w/o my input which I can not permanently disable; this is potentially an actionable thing Tesla has done by making a material change in the behavior of the car and essentially making it mandatory. I'm hoping they reconsider ...
Taking what you said literally, means you don’t want automatic emergency braking, ABS brakes or traction control, none of which can be permanently disabled and all of which take control of the car. Is this really the case?
""

Sorry for any confusion.. 

I do not want any setting where the car takes control without input from me; ABS works with me when I use the brakes, never (that I know of) w/o my foot on the brake but... 

yes, I don't prefer automatic braking because I have had it activate incorrectly, luckily just once but honestly in LA traffic with tailgaters, once was plenty . Called service, they schedule a camera recalibration service visit but the end result was no action, software is beta, it will get better. 

I have disabled the feature which limits acceleration if it thinks something is in front of the car and oddly that setting is allowed to stick. Inconsistencies are also frustrating.

Traction control I have mixed feelings on; this implementation has never taken control w/o input from me but I still insist that if a feature is not required by law and it's my car (I did pay for it) I should retain control over how it behaves 

I also don't think I'm being unreasonable; if these features were 100% (or ever 99) I might never have noticed they were there and it would have 'tricked' me into not caring.

A cycle is charging from 0% to 100% and then discharge again down to 0%. If you charge from 25% to 50% and then drive down to 25%, you need to do this 4 times to have a full cycle.
""

Actually you would have to do more than four times because shallow charges are better for the battery than full charges. In addition, this misses the point that for a given amount of power output the cells heat up more below 50% than they do above 50%, so driving in the 90% to 50% range is better for the battery than driving in the 50% to 10% range. But most of this is immaterial in practice because Tesla has a real battery management system, and even if the battery is never used and kept at 50% age will still deteriorate it. There are also other factors such as how much you heat up the battery by frequent full power starts, etc.",,0,0,0,0

The macros look really sucky. The timing is not very good for TSLA unfortunately, a situation that can be argued is very much self inflicted. 

But ask yourself this: If the S and P and QQQs drop thirty percent in the next six months, where does that put TSLA? How about fifty percent? I have been through brutal bear markets before, and there are no favorites played. All stocks will be dumped, and ‘speculative’ plays like TSLA get obliterated. We are starting from a low point with much technical damage. 

This should not change anything on a five to ten year horizon, but you can get crushed before you ever see that. The only way to protect yourself is to either have budgeted for a 100% loss or to use absolutely zero margin. 

Can you withstand a double digit stock price? How about a sub 50? Trust me, I am getting sick writing this. Even after the fifty percent haircut TSLA is still my largest holding by far. 

I am looking for TSLA specific catalysts to turn the tide, and they should be there, but no one pays any attention to that when recession hits. They sell everything relentlessly and then jump back in when the prices get to the point where even good companies with profits are priced for bankruptcy.

I didn't think so. But Tesla is known for having top-tier warranties. The LR Model 3 has an 8 year/120,000 mile drivetrain warranty (including the battery). I don't know of any warranty, from any competitor (gas or electric), that is better than that.

Yeah Tesla really dropped the ball with both messaging and implementation on this.


No charging should be limited, message appearing, or limits reset if more than 2 stalls are open at any supercharger

And for god's sake, give us a chademo/ccs adapter already.

They just seem confused as to what they want from the supercharger network for. Do you want Tesla owners to use it and make money off it? Then don't limit SC except at extremely busy superchargers. If you don't want them to use it then provide the chademo/ccs adapter so users have more options.
""

Tesla makes a Chademo adapter. I've seen it in the wild. It won't work with my car, but that's a different post. 

I don't agree that Tesla should only roll the charge goal back to 80% if 2 stalls are open. Remember that the second car on a pair is already rate limited. Goal is to get cars charged and out the door. Being the second car on a pair can severely cut your rate and extend your time. 

There's something they can do to cut charging times without inconvenience. Provide and indication of which stall you should use to get the highest charging rate. I've been able to get the max rate by changing stalls twice now. Each time it is a crap shoot though. You never know if it will be better or worse. 

Also, they should have a means of disabling stalls that are not functioning properly. I've ""discovered"" malfunctioning stalls at least twice. One I tied a knot in the cord (NOT SO EASY). A few minutes later a 10 year old untied it. lol Both chargers should have been disabled since Tesla already knew they didn't work. Even if the app didn't report it in the car, I'm sure they can turn off the red light! One failure was at Gaithersburg where it gets full.

Anyone with an SR+ (or any other config) driven from Vancouver to Whistler before?

Planning some day trips, just not sure how much of an impact the cold would make...

Fully charged SR+: 360-ish km(?)
Vancouver to Whistler: -121 km (-242 round trip, 90 mins each way)
Heated seats + A/C for 3 hours: -? km
Sentry mode: -10 km(?)
Phantom drain: - 2km
Range loss due to west coast winter: -??? km

I know the trip is definitely possible with supercharging in Squamish and Whistler, but it would be extremely impressive in my mind if I could drop my friends off that night without having to push pause during the day for charging.
""

Range Anxiety....

With a day trip, don't turn Sentry Mode on, and you shouldn't have to worry about phantom drain. 
Since you've got Superchargers every 60 km, it is a total no brainer. 

So, with those givens, if for some reason you are getting low, and assuming that Squamish is where you would stop, then you'd only need to take on about 60 km, or about 10 minutes. And after being in the car that long, getting a drink, relieving the bladder, and stretching the legs would probably already be on the agenda. 
Another option would be to charge in Whistler and have dinner with your friends. 

If you want to make sure that you can do the trip, drop the speed a little bit. 5 km/hr could have a huge difference for this trip. On the way back, the onboard nav will be your advantage, as, as long as you are routing home, it will let you know if you can make is and if questionable, it will suggest slowing to a speed for which it feels really comfortable.",,0,0,0,0

Yup, everything completed the same day. A month and no VIN. There have been a number of posts by folks who are being told by their delivery reps that Tesla is no longer producing on demand, but rather mass producing then matching production to orders.

Unfortunately for those of us buying M X, if true this turns into the proverbial lottery. Tesla has reduced staff, and reduced M X factory runs by 1/2 by ending the evening shift. Elon also stated that their main focus is on the M 3. Such an approach would explain why deliveries on the spreadsheet are no where close to sequential.

On the upside my Delivery rep did report that she could see my order was in production - but that there was still no vin match. This phrasing could support, or counter either production theory. The down side is that I read (from last year while the M X production line was running dual shifts) that it took 9 days to produce an X. With that down to 1 shift does this mean I am still 3 weeks out?

I dunno. It will arrive when it arrives - hopefully without issue.

And yet, they decided to lower the warranty for the 3 instead of leaving it the same.
""

The warranty for the Model 3 has never been lowered, it is the same warranty it was released with.

I asked you for an example of a competitor that offers a longer drivetrain warranty and you didn't come up with one. Leave it to Saghost to come up with Rolls Royce's 3 years, unlimited miles warranty. I'm not sure how that's comparable to the Model 3's 8 year, 120,000 mile warranty (because it would be awfully rare to drive over 120,000 miles in only 3 years). So, for practical purposes, the Model 3 warranty is much better than a 3 year, unlimited mile warranty.

Manufacturers can offer any warranty they like as long as they charge enough to be able to cover the warranty expense. It's a calculated risk and as the production volumes go up, so does the risk. Tesla is trying to make the Model 3 affordable so they don't want to be warranting unlimited miles over 8 years. They could offer a 3-year unlimited miles warranty like Rolls Royce but most consumers would see right through that. The short-sellers would have a field day! 

Funny thing is, Rolls Royce could warranty that the car would never run out of gas in the first 3 years but then they would have to build the cost of gas into the purchase price.",,0,0,0,0

A thing I have wondered about for a while now is why Tesla has not implemented heating of battery while braking? When temps are low and battery can`t utilize regen the mechanical brakes do the job now. Shouldn`t it be better if Tesla allowed for the engine to generate Power while braking, but send the energy to the battery-heater in S and X (6kW) or create waste-heat for the battery in Model 3? It is already possible to create a lot of Waste heat With the motor in Model 3 when using the SC-ready-feature. Is this something that is hard to enable? If possible it should be a win-win situation since range in Cold weather would be a bit better, brakes would last longer and fast-charging would be faster. Maybe this is impossible, but I would love to get Insight from those who knows this technical stuff better than me

I believe that this may already be occurring, it's called ""limited regen"" not ""no regen""

On The Media did a piece on attribution science two years ago but I still don't see the media picking up their pace. The science has come along as well, and some areas in Europe have rapid attribution services which provide the statistical outputs to the public.

There's no doubt that Tesla offers the most inspiring battery electric cars (by far). I wish the other competitive offerings were more available and more competitive but (as of 2019) they are not even widely available. And I think this has led you to conclude that these publications are ""Tesla focussed"" when the truth is, they cover what the public wants. For example, I was interested in the Hyundai Kona but I can't even buy one in Washington State! Most people have very little interest in reading about cars they can't even buy. Nevertheless, all of the publications mentioned have written about the Hyundai Kona. But the fact that they don't write about Hyundai as much as Teslas (which are actually widely available) is understandable.
""

Honestly, there is no reason to publish articles about videos of simulated races between a non existent vehicle and some other vehicle. Or the hundredth sentry Mode video. But when Audi officials talk about replacing the A8 and TT with electric successors, or Opel releases the Corsa as an electric vehicle, they just link to Motor1.

They still have articles about other EVs than Tesla. But I still wonder where this is leading. 

If you decide publishing a totally pointless article about a totally pointless video, but not one about the release of a new electric car (even if you can only buy it in Europe), then it’s pretty clear where the real focus is.

Soon you will find more EV news on the old mainstream car websites, while the EV sites move more and more to Tesla opinion pieces and Tesla related “car porn”. 

Maybe that’s also part of the problem, that you can only carve out your niche, if you make it smaller and EVs are big enough now, to not be a niche anymore. But for someone who only wants relevant EV news, I really dislike this trend.",,0,0,0,0

Driving out of DC during rush hour they deliberately reconfigure roads to run against the marked lanes. So parts of e.g. Canal Road you’ll be driving on the “wrong” side of the road because a two-way single lane road is temporarily designated a one-way two-lane road. And a million other things like that. I have to navigate around double parked cars or just people being stupid in the middle of the road all the time. I “absent mindedly merge by letting the car drift” all the time, if you mean the innumerable zipper merges around the DC area. Your one example would be way too much for me. 

There are so many spots in chaotic urban traffic where what you do—what you are even SUPPOSED to do—is not what the road markings literally indicate.
""

As long as you use turn signals and/or steer the car over lane lines, it won't activate. It only activates when there is no torque on the steering wheel. So literally the only scenario where it should activate is when you're just resting your hands on the wheel and let the car gradually drift over lane lines.

Just keep in mind that over 70% of all HW2.5 vehicles have 2019.16.2 right now. How many people have complained about the new features here? Fifty? For every 1 person experiencing issues, there are hundreds enjoying the new features.

The problem is that it sounds like you're unfamiliar with how commercial electricity is priced. It doesn't work the same way residential does, where most of your costs are related to how much electricity you use. For a usage case like a supercharger, the majority of the cost is going to be the demand charges, not the variable costs of the electricity itself. Yeah, they get a cheaper $/kWh price than the residential customers for what actually gets used, but that's likely missing 80+% of their bill for a sparsely used station.
""




tschmidty said:

I am aware of demand charges and obviously they are going to be high for a supercharger location but even at a sparsely used location they are almost certainly not going to be 80% of the electric charges. Even with demand charges, commercial power is cheaper than retail power. I also didn't factor ongoing maintenance, taxes or property leasing costs, it's called 'back of the napkin math'.

I am definitely not arguing that a sparsely used location is raking in profits for Tesla. I have no idea the average utilization of the supercharger network as a whole. My point being that the network could be managed as a self sustaining sector of the business in the future. I don't believe it is profitable now and I am certain that is not their intent.

I'd personally love to see Tesla deploy more 2/4/6 bay stations around towns in the future (not just on highways) since I think that would drive more usage but again you would need to analyze costs and usage so that could be completely impractical.

That being the case, and assuming there is enough demand from elsewhere and the lack of volume RHD vin registrations. It seems highly unlikely to me that Tesla will disrupt the production line during Q2 to tool up for the 5000 or so UK RHD orders on the books. cars that will never make it to owners in Q2 anyway. The logical time to start building the UK orders would be right at the Start of Q3 (or the last few days of Q2) when they will not disrupt Q2 but will comfortably make Q3 while allowing time to recover from any disruption to production they cause. That is my decidedly non expert take anyway.

There's a climate crisis – but Trump's cabinet continues to backtrack on science | Kate Aronoff

The irony in all of this is that Trump, Happer and company may have a firmer grasp on the epic scope of these climate projections than many Democrats. As Naomi Klein argues, even the right’s fervent conspiracy theorists tend to understand at some level how profound the implications of this crisis are for business as usual, which has distributed its profits among elites of both parties.

“Members of Trump’s cabinet,” Klein has written, “with their desperate need to deny the reality of global warming, or belittle its implications”, nonetheless “understand something that is fundamentally true. To avert climate chaos, we need to challenge the free-market fundamentalism that has conquered the world since the 1980s.”

We can’t know whether Happer genuinely believes the nonsense he’s spouting, or is just being paid well enough to sound like he does. The answer doesn’t really matter. Any clear-eyed assessment of what the science is telling us spells out who the winners and losers of rapid decarbonization would be. To cap warming at around 2C – a threshold many already dealing with climate impacts argue is too high – about three-quarters of known fossil fuel reserves will need to be kept underground, a reality that if realized as public policy would crater the stock price of energy companies.",,0,0,0,0

Not quite... you're talking about a resisitive heater that has the following design bits:

Can take up to ~50-100kW of power instantaneously (that's what regen is)
Has a way to funnel all that power back to the coolant without it immediately vaporizing
Can handle being cycled between 0kW to 100kW to 0kW instantly over and over.
If you don't have that, then the brake feel will be weird and mushy and you won't be able to do it for long.

I've increasingly thought that Tesla might be better focusing on driving 100% of the time on 60% of the roads rather than driving 60% of the time on 100% of the roads. By that I mean I would much prefer the car to be reliably left to drive on good quality freeways with low complexity and push for full autonomy on those conditions and take on the regulators to get permission to have the car responsible so I can work in the car and not need to concentrate, than have the car trying to drive in city areas and turn in junctions and stop at stop signs etc. The benefit for me on a 3 hour drive to let the car do ALL the driving for 2 hours of that journey would be amazing even if I had to drive the remaining hour without any aid and much better than having to pay attention for all 3 hours.",,0,0,0,0

Once when they lived in an apartment and had the cable run over 50m to their garage and paid $2800, the same person later moved into a house and paid $250 to have it mounted a few meters from their switch box.

The point is that the cost will vary greatly by complexity. Many Tesla owners have big houses and aesthetics are important to them. Some electricians want to run conduit externally around the house, this looks super ugly and may negatively impact resale of your home (ie have that discussion up front and avoid anyone who wont internally route the cable). 

I recommend insisting on 6mm cable, there is less heat and volt drop, meaning more power getting to the car and greater overall efficiency (on short runs this is very marginal) and cost impact is trivial.

Other than that expect about $500 for a short simple run to $1500 for an internal routing of a reasonable distance, but not extreme like my example above.",,0,0,0,0

As far as range, the biggest factor is how you drive the car. If you mash and dash, you can run any battery out very fast. If you drive moderately you will get a mile in 285-325 watts. That will get you close to rates range in warm climates.

First the OP. The OP seems to be living in a world where they could buy their house for 400k, and 6 months later find out that their new neighbor 4 doors down with the exact same floorplan bought their house for 350k, and expect to go to the seller and get a retroactive refund of 50k. Yes, that is what the OP is asking for. NO, the fact that its ""software"" has ZERO bearing on it. There is no industry that I am aware of where someone makes a purchase, and 6 months later gets a retroactive refund because someone else pays less. That simply does not happen. 

Tesla made a good will effort in the Model 3P with and without performance pack issue, and set a bad precedent. 

I will never understand the entitlement that people who feel like OP are feeling because ""someone else paid less than I did, so #@[email protected]#%@#$%[email protected]!!!!!!

Now, with that being said, that position is completely different than the one that @Az_Rael is stating, which , at least to ME IS a valid position to take. THAT position is one that PRE PURCHASED ""FSD"". He paid for it at Price XXXX. That product has still never been delivered, and he is unable to return and or rebuy it.

I purchased EAP with no FSD last year in december when I picked up my car. It cost 5k. What is in EAP (enhanced autopilot) is what now is in autopilot + FSD. The only difference is the different bundling of the products. Anyone who purchased EAP + FSD prior to the re bundling still has not received a single feature that is NOT available to those who just purchased EAP. So, @Az_Rael and those in his position have not received a product but yet cant return it.

I understand THAT frustration for sure. I also appreciate the thoughtfulness in which @Az_Rael expresses it (more resignation really, but definitely some frustration). Those in that position should be rightfully frustrated because they havent received a product yet.

Those who feel like OP ""I didnt buy AP with my car, but it cost as much as those who buy cars NOW with AP... so I want it free, how do I get tesla to give this to me??""

For this event they've added a SCCA PAX section thing for ""those not concerned with actual time"".

I'm going to be trying it out to see what happens, because frankly the way they class non-BMW cars means I've always been in a grab bag where times are not really remotely comparable, anyway.

Cost is $50, unless you happen to have a BMW CCA membership. Then the cost is $35. There are lots of designated Instructors on hand to help give you tips, whether you're new to Autocross or not. They'll even ride along in the passenger seat, or give you a ride in their car, which is very advisable if you're new.

A lot of fun. Even just watching or getting a ride, which is free, it is a hoot.

Important: At the BMW events, due to insurance requirements, you can only ride with, or give rides to, a certified Instructor. So don't bring a friend expecting to be able to give them a joyride. They'll have to watch. Or if you trust them enough, both of you enter as double drivers, which means you'll line up different in the pit and take turns driving the same car.

OMG, I can't agree enough! 

I'd like to keep a list of the REAL unicorns. AFAIK, there are:

1. 2014 P85 and P85+ with AP1 (i.e. ""The 300"")
2. ??
""

I'm thinking of an (the?) S85D with green exterior paint. To my knowledge, only one of these exists, originally belonged (maybe still does) to someone who used to be active here on TMC. It was made possible by timing and some sort of intervention during ordering or production. The owner didn't post any exterior shots of his car because he didn't want to get anyone in trouble, but someone finally got a picture of it at a Supercharger and posted it on TMC. To me that's a unicorn.

This leak could hurt demand again, but then it was probably inevitable. Perhaps concerning if they still haven't ramped S/X production beyond single weekday-only shifts, but then that may be necessary to allow time for combing the S and X lines to make way for Y.

Curious that the article mentions Y production starting in 2019 - not clear to me if that's just the author's interpretation of the factory news though or if she was specifically told that by Tesla employees.
""

Hard to think they'd update the S interior and not the X. Part of the purpose would be to update the car, but also to streamline production and reduce the space required for the combined SX production. If they are using half the plant for 10% of the cars, they are missing opportunity costs of better use of the space. Moving to 2170 also opens up the second floor, where the original motors and 18650 packs are built. If they streamline SX production and get both lines integrated, they can make room for the Y production and reduce staff needed to make the SX. Prior to the Y going into production the cost of the space used has not been critical. To consolidate production in Fremont, moving pack production out of Fremont now becomes equal to the savings of not building a complete new line and assembly infrastructure in Sparks. Keeping stamping, seats and other parts all local will keep the cost of the Y down and should speed up ability to bring the car to market sooner. It also reduces risk that the Model 3 production in Shanghai reduces Model 3 production below capacity. 

The leak could indeed be bad for demand, but leaking a more 3 like interior could inspire some buying for anyone who likes the current dual screen layout. Tesla has always had a PC\iPhone like demand issue where you know the car will be better if you wait. This change could be offset by the better tax refund, so timing for Q3 is not bad.",,0,0,0,0

You asked why I felt it didn’t inspire confidence. I told you why I felt that way. Doesn’t matter if you feel differently, it still doesn’t inspire confidence to me. 

I do not know of another drive train warranty that is longer than the Model S. Several companies offer 10/100K powertrain warranties that are equivalent to the 3’s 8/100K or 8/120K. Some might consider 10 years to be better than 8 if they don’t drive a lot. Also, powertrain warranties usually cover more than Tesla’s drive unit warranty does, like axle shafts so they are a bit difficult to equate. (Ask any Model S owner about the longevity of the S half shafts which aren’t covered by the unmilimted mile warranty).

My guess is that you don't live in the Netherlands (nor Belgium, the land of the really creative human- but not machine readable lane markings).

Yes.

Areas of concern:
-Two way traffic roads with two bike suggestion lanes, where you need to cross into the bike suggestion lane to cross other vehicles. High grass or a tree close to the roadside is sometimes enough to make ELDA freak out and jerk you into the incoming traffic. I see that someone already posted a similar incident above.

-road works with permanent but stale (white) lane markings and temporary and valid road markings (yellow) that weave in between the stale lane markings. Even Autosteer tends to follow the yellow markings, but sometimes ELDA balks at crossing the stale solid white lines and jerks you into following the now stale lane markings (regardless of what's driving there), sometimes even towards a concrete block (which surely is a less virtual obstacle than a solid line painted on the ground).

-Bus stops painted protruding into the right hand lane. You're supposed to cross these when there is no bus, but there are hatched areas to prevent people parking in front or behind the bus stop that ELDA sees as no-go areas (I guess it sees the bus stop as an ""obstacle"" that it should avoid, but bus stops fortuitously do not cross the road). At one point at one of these bus stops it jerked me to the left and disengaged AutoSteer, leaving the car pointed straight at a lamp post in the median strip.

To be honest: I usually don't wait to see if it will avoid the real obstacle it lobs me towards in order to avoid the virtual obstacle just for the sake of scientific curiosity. Perhaps it would jerk me back to safety avoiding the ""other"" (very real) emergency, but it should have had the foresight not to create that hazard in the first place.

In some cases the blame lies squarely on whoever was responsible for applying the road markings, but unfortunately we have little control over it. Just to give a couple of examples of really weird markings:

The ""London bus from Harry Potter"" markings...please tell me how not to cross the solid lines (obstacles placed very close to the roadside for extra fun!):


The ""bike lanes from hell"" markings (""I own the road"" cyclist optional):


Usually I know better than to use AutoSteer in these surroundings -- I have a hunch it might get confused. But the ELDA stays active nonetheless.

There are Google map links to some examples of things we've encountered that give it some trouble in the dedicated thread. If you're really curious, give it a read (no, we're not all Russian troll farmers, some of us are Real People (tm) ).

ELDA on highways (and similar roads) is quite useful, but we'd really need a way to enable or disable it using a voice command, and over here we definitely tend to not want to have to disable it every time we start a drive.

I’ll use myself as an example:
I currently own a 2018 Model S 100D and a 2018 Model 3 LR RWD. Unlimited free Supercharging on the MS as long as I own it. (An incentive not to upgrade this car to a newer Model S in the near to distant future)
I didn’t have any free Supercharging on the Model 3. Both cars do you have unlimited connectivity though.
Under the current promotion the free supercharging miles apply to all cars in the account. Although it has not been clarified, I assume that means it would apply to a new purchase as well.
Assuming all the referrals I have get delivered in the new program, I will have 73,000 miles with an 8-1/2 year expiration.
So basically unlimited free supercharging which I can utilize on any New Tesla I purchase, assuming they allow you to do that.

No, I wouldn't. Sure, it's like the OEM version for a lot less but that's where the pros end... not sure I think it's worth it after having personally bough two.

For starters, the lead times are quite long. Nothing like shelling out hundreds of dollars and waiting a month or so for something. Hell, you can order and entire Model 3 now and have it in about half the time to put it into perspective. The two that arrived had several QC issues that would have been caught if the company did any QC because they were pretty obvious. Working with ""customer service"" (I used air quotes to simulate sarcasm BTW) is a chore and they try awfully hard to ghost you if you have any issues at all. They're non-responsive and months later I'm still trying to communicate with them about these issues I had.

At this point, I would recommend biting the bullet and buying the OEM one which is better fit, finish & quality plus you can work with Americans for your order and any subsequent issues or consider one of the 3rd party options from EVANNEX or EVAMPED as a solution.

I purchased a used 2015 85D. Even without the P upgrade, Acceleration off the line is super fast, much faster than the vast majority of ICE cars. And all ICE cars at a $45K price point. Plus, after the first week or 2, you will likely go back to more reasonable takeoffs. For me, the 40-80 mph acceleration is more important and impressive. Let me pass that guy on the 2 lane road, or quickly get up to speed on the freeway! The line speed is a parlor trick IMO.
As far as range, the biggest factor is how you drive the car. If you mash and dash, you can run any battery out very fast. If you drive moderately you will get a mile in 285-325 watts. That will get you close to rates range in warm climates.
I would not get hung up too much on the minutiae.

The comparison was Starlink cell towers and conventional cell modems in cars versus Starlink terminals in every car along with the cell modem to handle cities, tunnels, high lattitudes. With the goal to provide closer to 100% coverage.

The Starlink towers would still provide 4G or 5G cell service. The difference is that they would not need fiber connections to the internet backbone or multiple RF repeaters (through other towers) to the backhaul. Instead, the tower would only need the 5G equipment, a Starlink terminal, and a power source. Solar + Powerwall/Powerpack would let you place a tower anywhere with sunlight regardless of existing infrastructure.

I apologize if it came out that way, when I made that post I was really frustrated - I put down a deposit and arranged the pickup of the car solely based on what Tesla was telling me on their used page for my car, but then I read about the battery problems and performance P90DL's have and felt extremely misled and extremely stupid (the two go hand in hand).

From what I've been seeing, P90DL's can have a lot of different battery versions, each with its own capabilities, and earlier V1 batteries are much closer to P85D's than P100DL's, but the Tesla used page lists them all as having the performance of the best possible battery. I'm not saying Tesla should have taken my car to the track to measure things, but they do know which battery it has, at least they could have tried to be more truthful and less misleading by grouping P90D's by battery version before issuing performance numbers.

Same thing with range. This is a 4 year old car, especially with the possible range degradation issues specific to 90kWh cars, it could have significantly lowered range. And yet Tesla is not telling me what the range is even though they so easily could. It's like reporting mileage - you can just literally look in the car and publish the range numbers for every specific car that way. How is telling me the car has 270 miles of range (which it's guaranteed to not have) (even though they could tell me the right one so easily) doing the right thing?

It might not be illegal, but it sure is very misleading.... to quote a master thinker, ""it's not fraud"", but ""it's false advertising"".
""

My hundred mile take is that you're putting WAY too much weight in what a few strangers say on the internet regarding the differences in 90 kWh battery revisions. Even if they're right and your v1 or v2 pack craps out early... who cares? You'll get it replaced with the newest version for free should that happen anyway.

You will thoroughly enjoy either a P85D or a P90D and likely wouldn't know the differences in performance even if you had them side by side and drove them back to back which you likely will never do. Don't stress. Buy what you want.

This whole v1, v2 & v3 fiasco with the 90 kWh cars & their differences is greatly overblown IMHO.",,0,0,0,0

I’m looking to expand my solar system by an additional four 330W Panasonic panels which the previous installer quoted me $4400 for the job. To me that is ridiculous since my inverter has plenty of capacity and all they need to do is add the panels in series. There’s plenty of roof space and all they need todo is bolt the hardware to the roof, slap the panels on, and plug them in...the system was designed with expansion in mind. 

So can anyone share with me your cost for systems being install in the greater Sacramento CA area, or anywhere in NorCal for that matter as a striating point. 

Seems I should be paying around $3000 for this job? Since I have an existing system does this need a new permit to expand by this small amount...?

By my math panels are about $300 online retail, solar optimizes are about $75 and think the total hard cost are about $1700 and my retail...I assume they have better purchasing rates....?
""

I do Solar Design for a few contractors, I think most installers would stray away from adding to a system as there are a bunch of unknowns and requires a lot of research to what was installed and how it was installed:

Are you sure the strings have less than 15 optimizers on them?
Do you have the plan sets and SLD's?
330 W Panasonic modules are one of the most expensive around and require large optimizers P400P. 
Is the inverter already oversized?

You have the (somewhat dubious) privilege of being the first case of a dead model 3 drive unit I've read about.

Of course, that means we wrong have any ideas what's wrong until Tesla tells you.

They probably haven't seen it before, either - that's why they want to keep the car for a bit I bet.

Replacing a drive unit is much, much easier than replacing an engine in a typical car, should only take them a couple hours - once they have a replacement ready for your car, but since this hasn't really been happening I doubt the service center has spares in inventory.

I took delivery of a model 3 on 5/2. Drive unit failed the next day with 90 miles on it. Unreal!!! I returned it and bought another and no problems so far. Any other car, i would have returned and walked away but love the M3. Alreadygot ny down payment back on the first one.

Thank you! You’ve described Autopilot so perfectly for me. I’m only a monthlong owner, but I’ve been struggling to explain to others HOW I find Autopilot so valuable. It’s the same idea as in the plane — you let it take care of the mundane but always remain in control and vigilant. Great comparison and hopefully I can do a better job explaining to others what makes it so great. 

So many people say “well if you can’t trust it and go to sleep, what’s the point?” Aye aye aye ....
""

When I'm describing it to people, I say that when you're driving, even though you're not consciously thinking about it, your brain is constantly micro-steering to stay in the lane, and that's tiring. You don't even realize it. With autopilot, your brain is not required to do this. You only realize how much more relaxing it is when you experience it. And without having to micro-steer, you have more brain power available to be aware of possible hazards. You can be more alert to what's around you and approaching. Its utility is limited, but extremely useful. You need to disengage it in situations where you can do a better job than it can, as well for turns, and for stops not forced by a car ahead of you. Overall, used properly, it makes you safer because you remain more alert, and you are far less likely to have an accident during those inevitable brief moments when your attention is distracted.",,0,0,0,0

↑

My solar installer advised me not to clean my solar panels - just let the rain do it. And mostly I've done that. They were installed June/July of 2014 and the first couple of years I got up there with a mop and a hose and cleaned them, but its a 2-hour pain in the [email protected]@ and I've been lazy.

Well, today I finally got up there and cleaned them again, and based on my Enphase system and my Neurio, I'm now getting 10-12% more power.

The sun has been mostly shining yesterday and today. There are some clouds, but when they clear the panels go to max power. Yesterday that was 4.9kw. Today, so far (its right at noon as I type) I am getting max peaks of 5.4kw.

Moral of this story, clean your solar panels!

See picture - I took this just now to show you my panels and guess what! I missed one DAMMIT. (clearly visible in the picture) Now I have to crawl back up there... But it gives you an excellent ""before"" and ""after"" what the panels look like.

View attachment 412543



Below shows the first panel I cleaned. I sat the mop on the panel next to it, which killed that panels production. So you can compare the output of the topmost panel after cleaning, with the bottom panels. Clear improvement.

View attachment 412558

""

You should clean your panels whenever they get a buildup of pollen and dirt. It makes a big difference just like it does with glasses. By the way your Enphase diagram is showing that panel #2 from the top is suboptimal. This is normally the case when the microinverter goes bad. in rare instances it is the panel diodes. Correcting the bad microinverter and cleaning the dirty panels will put you back at optimal output.",,0,0,0,0

↑

I've had 25 Enphase microinverters for four years with no failures. Earlier versions did have frequent failures but they seem to have fixed the design.
SolarEdge seems to have the worst design with both a central inverter and panel inverters.
""

I actually have a Enphase install, but the major issue with Enphase that I see is that your DC:AC oversub is at a per-panel basis instead of the entire inverter. Particularly for our location which has a 10kW-AC max for single phase installs to be net metering cap-exempt, that means your ideal max install is a 10kW SolarEdge inverter and 12-14kW DC of panels (we are a heating climate and moving most of our heating to heat pumps).
If you are using multiple roofs (particularly 90 degrees off), then this means you would very often be clipping individual micro-inverters but on a string inverter you would have plenty of headroom.
For a 330W-range panel, which seems to be the sweet spot right now, you would be seeing 250W max per panel on Enphase IQ7, but on SolarEdge you would use a P340 with zero clipping other than the string inverter itself. If you upgrade to IQ7+ on Enphase you consume too much of your AC allotment. I can regularly see my IQ7's maxed out at 250W. Enphase will tell you that you are not loosing that much because you are just chopping the top off the curve, but its still a hit.

Further if you are also trying to hit some AC cap, then on Enphase you are also are limited on this ratio between your panel choice and IQ7 or IQ7+.

I used an installer that was basically an Enphase shop and there was no discount for using SolarEdge (but they would if you insisted), but if I did it again I would probably just do SolarEdge. I mostly went with Enphase because they formally support the dual 200A panel consumption monitoring, but I have found my consumption monitoring to be very far off anyways as compared to a Fluke clamp-on meter, Sense, and my utility net meter.",,0,0,0,0

Full story:
My wife charged up to 100% on this trip as she was going far. When the battery was at around 56%, she felt what she described as the rear ""dragging"". During this time a message pops up saying ""Rear drive unit problem, car coming to a complete stop"" or something along those lines (i wasn't there). The car eventually comes to a complete stop in the middle of the road at 9pm. The message to try exiting and re-entering comes up (and doesn't work). Car won't shift into D or R. Wife calls Tesla support to explain the situation, and was told to call 911 (really?). I call Tesla myself to explain the situation, and they say they won't have a tow truck for the next 4-5 hours. While I'm trying to work out a tow with Tesla, I get a call from the wife because the police showed up and want to push the car off the road. I hang up with Tesla and walk through the steps with the wife to get it into transport mode. The car had trouble staying in transport mode, moving about a foot before the car shuts down (black screen, rear motors lock up). It took several reboots and putting into transport mode before they're able to get the car off the road. I couldn't have my wife sitting 150+ miles away by herself in the night for 4-5 hours, so I decided we'd use our our tow services with AAA to get the car to her friends house 40 miles away. The next morning, Tesla towed the car to the nearest SC. To which I got a loaner and was explained that the rear drive unit failed, it's rare, it's a big job, they'll need the car for a while as they want to monitor it after replacement, and that they'd let me know when its ready. This happened thursday night, today is Tuesday. Still waiting. They did not mention anything about the aftermarket sub or whether or not it had anything to do with the failure.

Does this change my love for the car? NO! I love it.

BUt it does leave me wanting more out of Tesla's support. I don't think tesla's response of calling 911 was appropriate. I also feel like the claims about having redundancy with having a dual motor car didn't work out here. And the fact that it kept coming OUT of transport mode can be frustrating/dangerous.

Anyways, just wanted to share as my googling of this issue has me concluded that while it has happened, it's not a super common thing.

I apologize for ranting, and am grateful for this sounding board. Please know that my rant isn't focused on Dems/Republicans..........it is focused on 'how in the HELL can anyone running for President be seen in public with the person who is shorting the most successful new American Company that is doing more than any other other American Company to save our Planet.' When even the DNC's top choice is holding hands with the worst of humankind we certainly don't have to ask ourselves any longer why Greta Thunberg stories are not run on our Mainstream Media in the good ol' US of A. 

This is really an 'In Your Face' moment. That is what I can't escape since learning of this yesterday. A Presidential Candidate at a fricking Fund Raising event with Jim Chanos after Tesla falls 50%. Perhaps there is a reason Elon hasn't spoken out about the Forces that he really thinks are working against Tesla. It sure explains why this whole Mainstream Media & SEC disaster was completely unchallenged by any politicians regardless of how obviously false it is. I apologize for venting.

Second, unfortunately this is the way almost everything works in the world. 

I'm normally the one that bashes Tesla, (Their service, their lack of communication, and their seemingly incapable of getting on the same page across the company), but this is an occasion where we get what we pay for. 

All who bought a brand new phone on fresh release will likely be paying the most, the next generation phone may be cheaper and better, we can't ask for money back, can we?

I bought SR+ with AP for 40k, a month later, that became 39.5k with AP included for all models except SR. I can't complain about that. My car doesn't have HW3, but I knew that before buying the car, I made the decision with the help of countless people contributing on this forum. 

Tesla is by no means a model car company, I don't think anyone on the forum can come out and claim Tesla being a great company.

People tend to cut corners and cross double yellow a bit into your lane so I tend to let car drift a bit over white line to have plenty of room. ELDA says nope and jerks you towards the oncoming car. Actually caused an oncoming car to jerk their wheel because they saw my car jerk towards them. Sure they were a bit over the line, but causing them to jerk their wheel mid turn is incredibly dangerous. 

On top of that out on the rural roads where I live (TN) there is roadkill every 3-5 miles, which I tend to gently steer around. While not as dangerous as the other behaviors ELDA will sometimes jerk me back into lane causing me to hit or run over the road kill. Dangerous but also rather unpleasant to spray guts over car and also potentially damage bumper or underside.

Long story short, maybe ELDA is great for city and highway, but pleeease let us turn it permanently off, its too easy to forget to turn it off every time.

4% should be fine if you are willing to drive slowly like you did.

If it had been a normal California day I'd have probably trusted the 4% and gone to Gustine. But it was still cold and very rainy even at the lower elevations. The Fresno prediction had dropped from 11% to 7% even with my conservative driving.

And I had rolled the dice earlier in the day just trying to get off the mountain before the snow storm got too bad and had slid off the road and was stuck for a couple of hours until a tow truck and chain installer arrived. Yes I'd been checking PlugShare often, and the most likely option would have been a bed-n-breakfast with two Tesla Destination Chargers in Mariposa. But it said call for reservations and I didn't want to spend any time nor electrons finding those stations only to be denied access. So I figured the safest thing would be to just go to Fresno.

I didn't want to roll the dice twice on the same cold and snowy/rainy day and lose both times.

↑

I actually have a Enphase install, but the major issue with Enphase that I see is that your DC:AC oversub is at a per-panel basis instead of the entire inverter. Particularly for our location which has a 10kW-AC max for single phase installs to be net metering cap-exempt, that means your ideal max install is a 10kW SolarEdge inverter and 12-14kW DC of panels (we are a heating climate and moving most of our heating to heat pumps).
If you are using multiple roofs (particularly 90 degrees off), then this means you would very often be clipping individual micro-inverters but on a string inverter you would have plenty of headroom.
For a 330W-range panel, which seems to be the sweet spot right now, you would be seeing 250W max per panel on Enphase IQ7, but on SolarEdge you would use a P340 with zero clipping other than the string inverter itself. If you upgrade to IQ7+ on Enphase you consume too much of your AC allotment. I can regularly see my IQ7's maxed out at 250W. Enphase will tell you that you are not loosing that much because you are just chopping the top off the curve, but its still a hit.

Further if you are also trying to hit some AC cap, then on Enphase you are also are limited on this ratio between your panel choice and IQ7 or IQ7+.

I used an installer that was basically an Enphase shop and there was no discount for using SolarEdge (but they would if you insisted), but if I did it again I would probably just do SolarEdge. I mostly went with Enphase because they formally support the dual 200A panel consumption monitoring, but I have found my consumption monitoring to be very far off anyways as compared to a Fluke clamp-on meter, Sense, and my utility net meter.
""

It's an interesting argument. Do you lose more due to clipping or due to partial shading? 
My installation consists of 16x 250w panels with 250w inverters and 9x 285w panels with 280 w inverters so clipping is not an issue. Shading is an issue and the Enphase inverters work well whereas strings would not.",,0,0,0,0

Why? Do you know of ANY non-Tesla car, gas or electric, that has an unlimited mile drivetrain warranty?

I didn't think so. But Tesla is known for having top-tier warranties. The LR Model 3 has an 8 year/120,000 mile drivetrain warranty (including the battery). I don't know of any warranty, from any competitor (gas or electric), that is better than that.

So it's curious why this doesn't inspire confidence. Unless you just want to spread negativity about Tesla in general.
""

I think it's fair to be concerned.

120K miles isn't that far for some folks. Especially with today's ICE engine longevity. Couple decades ago I considered anything over 100K on borrowed time. Today I consider that 200K. Just about any ICE engine that is well maintained should go 200K. And if it doesn't it's rarely completely blown. Might need new valve job or something. Blown engines do happen of course that require full replacement.

The Electric Motors are not very servable. It's all or nothing and very expensive to replace.

I hope Tesla offers an extended warranty soon for the Model 3. Because some people will be hitting the 50K (bumper to bumper) miles soon. I personally will probably get the full 8 years out of it because I expect to only put 12K a year and will definitely sign up for extended warranty. If I don't see it by 3 years and 36K miles I'll probably sell it.

I've been on the Jeep forums for 5-6 years. I don't recall one blown engine post. Plenty of lemons and buy backs but no blown engines.
In 8 months I've seen half a dozen blown drive units on Telsa's. Everyone covered under warranty.

I wonder if there are any stats on Performance, Ludicrous, etc. if there is any correlation. Probably not enough stats to judge (which is a good thing).

I'm not that worried but I will stay ahead of it.",,0,0,0,0

Yes, got delivery of my model S that day!
My flight was very late, like 3 hours. Even though, I called the tesla at paramus and they were super understanding.
When I got there, it took only about 20 minutes to drive away with my Tesla.
The delivery was rushed and I also was in a rush, so didn't look well at the car. As soon as I stopped to charge I started noticing some dents in the interior and also lots of swirling on the paint (maybe from past cleaning jobs). I took some videos of that after getting out of tesla, but really dont know if I can ask for repairs or anything.
I drove from New York to Florida very smoothly. Only my MCU was resetting all the time, erasing my info and turning off autopilot. Though, as soon as I updated my system the problem disappeared.

There are my pictures of the car and also I would like to know if I argue with tesla or not. Thank you guys for the support!

I personally prefer the S to the 3. but i feel like I am in the minority.
""

I loved and was ready to buy the Model S 75D and decided it would be prudent to test drive the Model 3 before pulling the trigger. It took 5-min (Oct 2018) to convince me to love the Model 3 more. 

The Model 3 seating position is more comfortable than the S, and you can see out of the car better.
M3 performance is more nimble than an S and feels like a Porsche sports car (but is smooth for long trips), fulfilling my old desire for a 911 which I had forgot I had until driving this car.
M3 interior is much better than the S, more modern, striking and has storage. Model S interior storage is VERY lame, no door pockets etc???
M3 stereo sounds better than S. This was my instant judgement after hearing both.
In Oct 2018 the M3 motors were more modern design than the S. This influenced me even though I still believed I would be a beta tester for the new M3.
I paid $10k less for the hottest Perf M3 than an a standard S75D.

Bought a massive squeegee pole and fret that I will drop it end wise on the glass... but a quick sponge and flip to squeegee does the trick. 24 panels in about 30 mins. An hour full up. Most of the time, measure about a 3% improvement. 

I agree with an earlier post, that 3% improvement does not last long. Dust is back in a few weeks. But I feel better for having tried.

Cloud cover and temp are way bigger factors. They even swamp degradation. But the real measure is against consumption. Year five was my best so far in terms of net production. Swapping an electric dryer for gas had a much bigger impact than any cleaning of panel’s would get. That combined with probably the sunniest year of the 5 produced over a MW more than consumed. Yes, that includes charging my S100D.

This year production is way down due to inordinate cloud cover. But daily production on sunny days are way up, best ever, because it’s 10 degrees F or more cooler than usual for this time of year. Not really able to measure degradation over 5.5 years as weather swamps the effect.

So ya, here, especially this year thankfully a wet one, cleaning not needed. But after a month of dry with no rain in sight... up I go up to earn my 3%.... about 1 kWh for a day... 17 cents on tier 1. But really 3 cents since I over produce and that’s what I earn from SCE. Bite me.",,0,0,0,0

Yea, I was referring to the CCA generation rates from renewables increasing over time. They seem to want to get closer and eventually match the rates. So, if PG&E raises their rates, the CCAs will continue doing so as well. PG&E is public, and have issues like you said. No reason for them to lower rates, and thus no reason for the CCAs to do as well.
Unfortunately, regardless of how many incidents they have and how big those associated liabilities are, they’ve become one of those giant entities that are “too big to fail.”



That would support my point of increasing demand leading to increase in price. But, again, my point was about the generation. You’re referring to the distribution (I think). Our charges are broken down into generation and distribution.
""

I was too terse. Let us put it this way. If your electric price is over 14 cents per kWh, put up your own solar panels and save money. If it is over 30 cents, put up Power walls too and go off the grid. There is a hard cap on electricity prices if you have your own sunlight and access to capital. For those who have to pay higher interest rates, these numbers are higher of course. But both numbers drop every single year.

If you do not have a roof or land with sunlight you may be at the mercy of the utility company or landlord, but most of the country does. Competitive pressure...

You should clean your panels whenever they get a buildup of pollen and dirt. It makes a big difference just like it does with glasses. By the way your Enphase diagram is showing that panel #2 from the top is suboptimal. This is normally the case when the microinverter goes bad. in rare instances it is the panel diodes. Correcting the bad microinverter and cleaning the dirty panels will put you back at optimal output. I clean my panels twice a year. In Florida we have roofs without a lot of slope so cleaning makes a difference.
""

Hey Bobbygood,I also live in the Orlando area and my roof has a slope,I would think those torrential downpours we get here in Orlando would be enough to keep them clean......How much does it cost to have them cleaned???Will you recover the cost of cleaning ,if not I probably won't do it...thinking of installing some this year.....any insights with a local slant???",,0,0,0,0

Other than being filthy, which was expected, it looked perfect to me. As we chatted about Tesla in general, she told me she wouldn't buy a Tesla because of the terrible fit of the panels. She pointed out to me where some panel gaps were larger than others. 

I could see the differences she was showing me, and you know what? It still looked perfect to me. Yes, the gaps between panels are not exactly uniform. But none are too big or too small. IMO, that is. I told her that, yes, I could see what she was pointing to. And then I told her about charging the car with free solar power rather than burning the environmental disaster that is gasoline. I told her about zero to sixty in just over 5 seconds with no shifting. I told her about having the industry's most advanced autopilot (admittedly a misnomer, but an amazing feature). I told her about the five star safety rating in every category. And then I told her that I really didn't care at all if the variation in panel gap width was greater than it is in some other car. I also told her about the issues around the phone-as-key and my opinion that the glass roof was a bad idea, and that I had to pay for the upgraded interior that I didn't want (though I like it now) but had to pay for to get the car when I did, and that if I'd known I was going to move here I would not have gotten the long-range battery.

As someone who currently (I have a M3 SR+ on order) drives a Leaf with only 12 kw of actual available power (2012 - bad battery loss), I know a thing or two about range anxiety and the reality is you get used to thinking about it and generally ""find a way"" to make the power work. I mean, certainly, if you can afford and have the desire to get the LR version then definitely do it, but I'd bet a lot of people make the decision based on fear and that's not the best way to buy an automobile. The Standard Range (particularly if it's a software-locked larger battery) should do fine for most people 99%+ of the time. I guess it's all how you handle the 1%.

As more superchargers open up, the SR makes sense in a lot more areas as well. Just in the 9 months I've had my Model 3, 2 new superchargers have opened up ""in just the right spots"" to substantially ease my range anxiety with the LR, as well as making an SR much more feasible in this area.

So Tesla has acquired an exciting dry battery electrode process by buying Maxwell Tech. So what is the next step? Clearly, they would want to set up some prototype production line but Tesla has no experience making battery cells. So license it to Panasonic? Make 18650 battery cells for the refreshed Model S with DBE? Making 21700 battery cells using DBE and then having to redesign the battery-pack? You can't switch the Model 3 battery cells to DBE because the demand for battery cells per week is so huge..but the refreshed Model S would have a far lower demand at the beginning. Or do you want the DBE battery cells for the Roadster only? I can see huge efficiency gains to get the Gigafactory making battery cells for the Model S - either 21700 or 18650.
""

Maxwell said they were building a pilot line last year to prove the DBE process works at scale. They never said it was running, so presumably they ran into cash/tech problems. First order of business is to get that line running in its current location. It probably makes pouch cells, so maybe Tesla makes some one-off Powerpacks to test/use at Superchargers or something.

Second step is to hook a single cell-winding machine up to the pilot line and make some 2170s. Tesla can use these in customer Powerpacks and Powerwalls. Finally, once DBE is proven and Panasonic has enough surplus capacity, retrofit a single line at GF1 to make DBE 2170s to use in storage products and eventually vehicles.",,0,0,0,0

Tesla sold AP2.0 as FSD capable, just like they sold P85D's as 691hp capable.

AP2.0 FSD will end the same way, except any lawsuit will have much harder time succeeding because of the fine print they were smart to add since day one of FSD - nobody can predict when this will become available.

Nearest service center is 250 miles away, so repairs as a result of the charge system failure were were inconvenient and lengthy. That was last October. Since then, the car has been fine and we love the driving experience, but the early negative delivery experience coupled with the hardware failures will leave a lasting impression. I had a similar experience in 1970 with an American brand. I drove other brands for the next 30 years. Tesla must fix these problems now or there will be few new and repeat customers in the future, and that would be a tragedy.

Could be a good deal but I would underwrite the downside risk of Tesla not renewing the lease and you having a vacant building configured for a car dealership - look at the Schaumburg facility for example - if you own such a property without a tenant - you are going to have to pay the carry on the property (property taxes, insurance, mortgage debt, etc_ till you release or sell it. Since traditional auto dealerships are being disrupted - I wouldn't be too confident that you will have a line of companies with solid credit standing in line to take down the property. You may then have to redevelop the property into another use (tear down and build something else).. For the relatively low cap rate - you are better off just buying some sort corp bond (like Tesla) at a higher yield and more flexibility on liquidating your position if needed..

Short answer - wouldn't be a player here ..
""

Thanks for the feedback all great points. One thing I have been curious about is the tenant improvements required to run a Tesla service center. As Tesla and other electric car makers continue to grow, are there any improvements such as highly specialized electrical capacity or specialized equipment/service docks that may make these facilities attractive to other companies?

That's expected for Hawk pads, they suck, only acceptable on light cars that don't need much brakes.

Raybestos/Porterfield pads are great for heavy cars, originally designed for nascar back in the day. Caveat is that even their st-43 is way too aggressive for a light car like a miata.

My current plan is to grab the girodisc rotors from mountainpass, and then send a brand new set of pads to raybestos/porterfield for them to measure and make the custom size, very affordable. They are a traditional race shop like coleman racing, so horrible website, but if you give them a ring they take care of you. Wendy at porterfield really knows her stuff, schooled me a few times on friction compound splits between axle's and why my great idea is actually terrible, lol.

I think it's fair to be concerned.

120K miles isn't that far for some folks. Especially with today's ICE engine longevity. Couple decades ago I considered anything over 100K on borrowed time. Today I consider that 200K. Just about any ICE engine that is well maintained should go 200K. And if it doesn't it's rarely completely blown. Might need new valve job or something. Blown engines do happen of course that require full replacement.

The Electric Motors are not very servable. It's all or nothing and very expensive to replace.

I hope Tesla offers an extended warranty soon for the Model 3. Because some people will be hitting the 50K (bumper to bumper) miles soon. I personally will probably get the full 8 years out of it because I expect to only put 12K a year and will definitely sign up for extended warranty. If I don't see it by 3 years and 36K miles I'll probably sell it.

I've been on the Jeep forums for 5-6 years. I don't recall one blown engine post. Plenty of lemons and buy backs but no blown engines.
In 8 months I've seen half a dozen blown drive units on Telsa's. Everyone covered under warranty.

I wonder if there are any stats on Performance, Ludicrous, etc. if there is any correlation. Probably not enough stats to judge (which is a good thing).

I'm not that worried but I will stay ahead of it.

Ehh, he shouldn't burn down the house since the 30A breaker *should* trip. Now if it doesn't trip, then yes, burned down house is likely.

Honestly, it's entirely possible it wouldn't. 32A (what a UMC gen 2 would pull) is within margin for continuous operation (where it wouldn't trip) if certain conditions are right.

Most breakers I've seen have current-time curves that imply they won't trip until 1.2x their rating even after an infinite time, assuming the temperature is right. And that's no good for the wiring... 

Here's a 30A GE breaker (first one I found):

My thought is this because I thought it's stupid too.

Tesla has zero plans in bringing over SR+ to China because it's not worth the logistics due to this being a lower margin car.

I'm not sure how much cannibalism of the LR AWD there will be announcing the price since these are two vastly different car in range, power and ""quality"".

No, it actually isn't. It is weird and unwise, but the code does not disallow that. It says that the breaker must be no higher than the rating of the outlet type, but it doesn't restrict it being lower, even weirdly lower, like a 20A or 30A breaker with a 50A outlet type. It may cause nuisance trips, and it's kind of lazy or sloppy, but not actually forbidden.
""

Well, I see someone marked it as ""disagree"". I guess that's fair since I'm just some guy's opinion on the internet until I quote the section of the National Electric Code that confirms it:
Multiwire Branch Electrical Circuits and Split-Wired Receptacles - Electrical Wiring Safety Requirements

The specific section is 210.21(B)(1)
""A single receptacle installed on an individual branch circuit shall have an ampere rating not less than that of the branch circuit.""

Notice that is a one way restriction. The outlet type cannot be lower than the breaker. Section 210.21(B)(3) from that same page is about when you have multiple receptacles on a branch circuit, and then they do have a table about requiring the outlet type to match the circuit rating. But for single outlet on a circuit, that does not apply.

Now it should not ever have nuisance trips, because of section 210.23:
""210.23 Permissible Loads. In no case shall the load exceed the branch-circuit ampere rating. An individual branch circuit shall be permitted to supply any load for which it is rated. A branch circuit supplying two or more outlets or receptacles shall supply only the loads specified according to its size as specified in 210.23(A) through (D) and as summarized in 210.24 and Table 210.24.""

The rating of the circuit, which is defined by the breaker, does need to supply the load that will be connected to it. There are smaller load devices (such as some J1772 charging devices) that will have a load of like 16A or less, but they have plugs on them that fit outlet types like 6-30 or 14-50. That would be allowed to use something like a 14-50 outlet type for it, but use the 20A breaker to match the intended 16A load.",,0,0,0,0

My, we certainly have a lot of opinions in this thread about who is right or wrong for a Tesla.

There is nothing wrong with wanting your vehicle to be in good condition on delivery day. Paint issues are usually a hassle to deal with since Tesla does not fix them in house. I would not accept delivery on a car that has significant paint issues requiring body work. That’s just silly. It’s a brand new car. You don’t need to be messing around with taking a brand new car to a body shop to get it repaired before you even paid for it. They make over 5,000 of these a week. If you don’t like the one they assigned to you then just request another one. No big deal.

Where I see things go wrong is when people allow Tesla (or their own schedules) to rush them through the delivery process. You should plan on spending an hour going through the vehicle in detail. Bring a second person to go through it with you in case you miss anything. You are doing a pre-purchase inspection on an expensive piece of property. Take the time you need to make sure you have thoroughly inspected it and don’t be afraid to reject it if there are issues you are not comfortable with. We have two Model 3’s that we are very happy with and we’ve had zero issues with both of them. And we’ve also rejected two Model 3’s that were not in acceptable condition at the delivery center. In both cases where we rejected the vehicles the entire staff was very friendly and supportive and totally understanding of the situation.

I’m helping a family member pick up an SR tomorrow. I’ll be going through it with him carefully to make sure it’s in good condition and I have a backup plan in place in case we need to reject it.

It's an interesting argument. Do you lose more due to clipping or due to partial shading?
My installation consists of 16x 250w panels with 250w inverters and 9x 285w panels with 280 w inverters so clipping is not an issue. Shading is an issue and the Enphase inverters work well whereas strings would not.
""

I don't think there are any shading issues with the SolarEdge optimizers (which I believe is basically a DC-DC converter). You trade-off the failure mode of the sum of the string inverter plus the optimizer instead of a single failure of the microinverter (since the reliability of the passive combiners is very high, only really mechanical failure modes, no electrical failure mode). You would think there would be an efficiency loss but SolarEdge is actually better.

SolarEdge Optimizer 98.8% efficient, Solaredge SE10000H 99.0% efficient = 97.81% net

So with around 7600 miles on the clock on my P3D+, the rear drive unit has failed.

Worth noting that I took delivery during 3rd quarter in 2018 (THE quarter when Tesla was pushing HARD to crank these out), AND I have self-installed an aftermarket sub/amp system. For what its worth, I've installed audio systems in my own cars for the last 8 cars and while that doesn't make me a pro, I also like to think I did it right/clean.

The short: rear drive unit failed, they're replacing the entire unit, i feel l

Full story:
My wife charged up to 100% on this trip as she was going far. When the battery was at around 56%, she felt what she described as the rear ""dragging"". During this time a message pops up saying ""Rear drive unit problem, car coming to a complete stop"" or something along those lines (i wasn't there). The car eventually comes to a complete stop in the middle of the road at 9pm. The message to try exiting and re-entering comes up (and doesn't work). Car won't shift into D or R. Wife calls Tesla support to explain the situation, and was told to call 911 (really?). I call Tesla myself to explain the situation, and they say they won't have a tow truck for the next 4-5 hours. While I'm trying to work out a tow with Tesla, I get a call from the wife because the police showed up and want to push the car off the road. I hang up with Tesla and walk through the steps with the wife to get it into transport mode. The car had trouble staying in transport mode, moving about a foot before the car shuts down (black screen, rear motors lock up). It took several reboots and putting into transport mode before they're able to get the car off the road. I couldn't have my wife sitting 150+ miles away by herself in the night for 4-5 hours, so I decided we'd use our our tow services with AAA to get the car to her friends house 40 miles away. The next morning, Tesla towed the car to the nearest SC. To which I got a loaner and was explained that the rear drive unit failed, it's rare, it's a big job, they'll need the car for a while as they want to monitor it after replacement, and that they'd let me know when its ready. This happened thursday night, today is Tuesday. Still waiting. They did not mention anything about the aftermarket sub or whether or not it had anything to do with the failure.

Does this change my love for the car? NO! I love it.

BUt it does leave me wanting more out of Tesla's support. I don't think tesla's response of calling 911 was appropriate. I also feel like the claims about having redundancy with having a dual motor car didn't work out here. And the fact that it kept coming OUT of transport mode can be frustrating/dangerous.

Anyways, just wanted to share as my googling of this issue has me concluded that while it has happened, it's not a super common thing.

Anybody else experience this issue? I'm driving a 2019 Model 3 Performance. I'm not seeing many complaints about this particular issue online, or from other Model 3 owners, so I'm wondering how common this is.

I don't believe I ever had 8.5 so I don't know about that.

The whole point that he drives home in that video is that this thing he's demonstrating in the video is actually an extension of AP, that its only there right after you've disengaged AP.

What's happening now is it'll do something entirely separate from AP. First time it happened for me I was parked overnight, left the house and hadn't yet reached roads where AP could be engaged, and it fired off when I was turning a corner (on roads with no lane markings).
""

Also, as pointed out on this video, this ONLY happens if you DRIFT out of your lane WITHOUT steering input. If you STEER out of your lane, the car lets you get on with it.

In the cases I have experienced, it occurred WHILE I WAS STEERING attempting to over-rule what I wanted to do. It's also not a gentle, guide you back into the center of the lane it's an aggressive TURN RIGHT, or TURN LEFT, including taking you out of the lane you was already centered in, or on to the opposite side of the road.

The ""Lane Departure Assistance"" is like what's in the video, and you can turn that on/off. No problem with that.

1. You are launching on glue(literally). Adhesion is the major factor for traction, not friction. This means more contact patch will have a measurable impact in preventing wheel spin.
2. Sidewall stiffness matters. When cornering, you want a stiffer sidewall to prevent the tire from rolling off the wheel. in straight line, you want a softer sidewall which acts like a rubber band and smooths out the application of torque to the road.
3. Rolling resistance plays a measurable role. More rolling resistance means a slower trap speed. We also see this exact effect with efficiency differences between all seasons and performance summer tires.

Points 2 and 3 are actively taken into account by anyone who is interested in better 1/4 mile times. Racers will buy a specific set of tires to increase traction at the expense of trap speed. When at the track, they will adjust air pressure in the tires to try to find the best combination of sidewall stiffness and contact patch relative to the specific conditions of the drag strip that day.

Of the above points, the only benefit for running 21"" tires would be a wider contact patch which will come at the expense of sidewall stiffness. The other two points speak directly to the benefit of running 19"" wheels with low rolling resistance tires.",,0,0,0,0

I wonder how many people have had reason to click the dash-cam icon to save off some footage, and then bothered to look at it.

People do regularly view their Sentry videos though, it seems.

Anyway, my dashcam footage *is* affected. I was rear ended, and went to look at the footage that I saved off later.

I had also just left work 2 minutes before the accident where Sentry mode was on. So, I have a bunch of Sentry footage, followed by 10 minutes of ""saved"" dashcam footage (because I pressed the button to save after the accident), and then, 2.5 hours later, after leaving the accident scene, I ""saved"" again to get footage of the offender leaving the scene before me (so I had a recording of his rear license plate).

All of this footage shows varying levels of corruption, but, to be fair, Sentry seems the best of all of it. As if the codec has trouble with large amounts of moving information (while driving, versus parked). (just a guess based on the types of corruption I'm seeing)

There are only two bearings which might wear out, not that hard to replace them. More likely is a failure of an electronic component in the inverter, which should also not be that difficult to swap out, or just replace the inverter as a whole unit.
""

Can you provide a link of when such bearings have been replaced by Tesla and the price of such a repair?
Quite often if a bearing goes, a lot can go with it. Depends on how early it's caught.

I agree, the Model 3 is nicely designed to ""swap"" out the Inverter etc. Because everything except the motor and battery are on a large complex modular sub assembly. That piece would probably cost $10k or more to ""buy new retail"". However, what they may likely do is swap in a refurb and get the old one refurbed on the bench. That is what they are doing on battery warranties. They don't give you a new battery. They give you a refurb.

A Tesla Model S door handle is a $1000, what do think Tesla would charge for the drive electrons module? Even if it was a swap for refurb?

Fact is, nothing is cheap about Tesla's. And we really have no idea what the costs will be long term or the reliability. Model S/X certainly have seen bright spots and dark spots. We all hope the Model 3 will be better.

A friend has a 2014 Model S with 120K miles. He has spent $10k in repairs. 3 Door Handles ($1K each), Main Display ($3K), Emergency Brake Caliper Seized ($1.3K) etc. He was dumb not to get extended warranty and still loves the car and will buy another buy he WILL buy the extended warranty next time. He is on his 3rd Drive unit (covered under warranty) !! Many ICE Car owners do you personally know of with it's 3rd engine? He'd be out of Warranty on a Model 3 now.

I have not spent $10K in repairs in the last 20 years on two family cars 600K+ miles (ran two over 200K). I always get extended warranty. My Jeep has unlimited miles lifetime warranty for $2500 ($100 deductible).

3701619,"Shorting Oil, Hedging Tesla",jhm,2019-05-29 09:07:00,"An under-the-radar way to measure economic growth in China is painting a bleak picture


This is a curious example of how journalists and even economists can misunderstand the impact of vehicle electrification on the economy. China reports GDP growth at 6.4% in Q1 this, but this is called into question as diesel demand has be plummeting, down 14% and 19% in March and April. The journalist congratulates himself on finding the dark underbelly of the Chinese economy.


But wait a minute, what else could be impacting specific diesel demand in China and growth in the economy. The journalist overlooks the fact that China has be growing a massive fleet of electric buses and is also building out electric trucks too. BNEF has estimated that electric buses displace about 270 kb/d of diesel. This displacement should be taken with a grain of salt, however, because there are microeconomic factors that can greatly amplify the displacement effect. Electric buses operate within fleets that also include diesel buses, but the electric have a much lower operating cost. Both the fuel cost per mile and maintenance per mile are lower, and this is a strong enough opex advantage as to offset the higher capex requirement for electric buses. But low cost per mile is what drives utilization throughout the year. To minimize fleet opex, an operators will seek to get the most mileage out of vehicles with the least running cost. This means an electric bus could have twice the displacement of fuel if it is utilized twice as much as the average diesel bus. So BNEF’s nominal estimate of displacement 270 kb/d could be off by a factor of 2 over the course of a year.


This ratio also depends on what fraction of the fleet electrics comprise. Suppose it is some fraction P. If P/(1-P) is small, then diesel utilization must be close to the average for the fleet because there are just not enough electric buses to relieve diesels from duty when demand is low. But as P/(1-P) increases, then diesel service can be relegated to being backup vehicles used only when demand really high. So here the utilization of diesel buses can fall off a cliff. Maybe they used to be operated 80% of the time, but that falls to less than 20%. Meanwhile, the electrics are used near 90%. So when P was small, one electric maybe did the work of 1.125 diesels, but as P increases, one electric does the work of 5 marginal diesels. So the point here is that in fleet service fuel displacement is not constant, but an increasing function of P.


Furthermore, let’s consider how demand for transit bus service can change with the seasons. It is possible that on a nice spring day, some riders will prefer to do more walking, riding bikes or scooters. This means that marginal, backup diesels are not needed so much and spend less time in service. Seasonal variation in demand can also induce the leveraging effect of P in the previous paragraph. If this leverage is strong enough would could see an amplification of seasonality in diesel demand. As electrics displace diesel, seasonal fall off in demand will be sharper than it was in prior years. So a seasonal fall off in spring could be a function more electrics in transit fleets.


Is this enough to see diesel demand fall off 14% and 19% in March and April? Maybe not entirely, but energy economists need to be doing a much better job at analyzing the impact of electric fleets on the seasonality of diesel demand.


Turning to the GDP side, we also can note that building out these electric fleets of buses, trucks and cars is consistent with growing China’s economy while reducing fuel demand. Specifically, net imports of fuel can be offset by China’s manufacturing prowess. So this has implications both for the labor market and the balance of trade. And in particular, it makes China’s economy more resilient to the effects of a tariff ‘war’ with the US. It is simply a matter of time and scale. At some point the growing EV industry adds more to GDP growth while displacing oil demand that undermine diesel demand as a proxy for economic growth. Yes, the economy can be growing just fine as diesel demand plummets. This is not a “bleak picture.” It is a brighter horizon.",,0,0,0,0

The question that has to be asked is the cost of cleaning the solar panels worth the extra energy you get from cleaning them?
For me it is a No. I had my panels cleaned once and it just isn't worth the cost. I have a two-story house and no way am I climbing up on my roof to clean my panels. To many ways that could go wrong.
""

Precisely my thought and my policy. Not worth the extra small power (from past years of experience on 3 homes), and the risk of personal injury. 

As I think we all know, there are a lot of variables at play. The main one being what kind of an area are people located. My San Francisco East bay home was getting more dirt than the one up here in Nevada where there is very little dirt and then the rain and snow do a good job of keeping them clean enough. I've also noticed in recent years that often just spraying them down does about as much improvement as wiping them off. That is on my San Diego home just one story high and I can do it from the ground. Thus having about the same effect as a heavy rain.

As a side note for the OP, you probably know this, but you really can't accurately compare one day to the next day even if it is the very next day. What I am referring to here is you don't mention the cloud coverage comparison during the two days. I have noticed in the past that ""Cloud enhancement"" can account for as much as a 10-13% boost in power during parts of the day, so you can't look at just the peak power.

You can buy a cheap (real) electric meter on ebay. Electric companies are switching to smart meters, so there are a lot of the older analog clock hand variety. You just need to install the standard meter base to plug the meter into. 

At my house, I bought a small resettable KWH meter. I think they were $16 with a 100amp current tap. But your co-op might want to know you didn't reset the reading to zero mid-month.

Quite often if a bearing goes, a lot can go with it. Depends on how early it's caught.

Tesla probably just replaces the whole motor, then sends the old one to be repaired, and that one would end up in another vehicle. Of course a catastrophic bearing failure could cause more damage but in most cases bearings wear gradually and start making noise so they will be caught before complete failure.

I see you are in Colo so the following comment may not apply but you can check in your state. And it could help someone from Calif facing the same situation.

In Calif an automotive repair must provide you with all the old parts they replaced if you ask in advance with a few exceptions.
A Consumer's Guide To Automotive Repair In California



When you sign the written estimate or work order, you can ask the shop to return to you any parts that were replaced. The shop is required by law to return the parts to you only if you ask for them before the work is done.

If the shop installs a rebuilt part, the old part is usually returned to the supplier as partial payment for the rebuilt part. This payment is called a ""core"" charge. If you want the old part back, you may have to pay the core charge.

If the shop must return the replaced parts to the supplier under a warranty, you will not be able to get those parts back, but you have a right to see them.

If the shop charges for hazardous waste disposal, the technician or service writer must list the charge and its Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) number on the invoice.

Tesla Order Rate Surges 25% Worldwide, 116% In North America, According To New Data | CleanTechnica



It looks to me (and many others here) like a lot of Q1 was pulled into Q4, and now it is back to ""normal""
""

Tesla entered the quarter with 2,907 cars in transit from Q4, delivered 63,000 cars, and had 10,600 cars in transit to customers at the end of the quarter. This implies 70,693 orders in the first quarter over 90 days, or 785 orders per day.

With 980 orders per day in Q2 so far, according to the leaked internal email, that is a 25% increase over the 785 order per day rate in Q1. This methodology for calculating orders is adopted from twitter user @vgrinshpun.

For those of you who aren’t familiar with @vgrinshpun, he was at one time a very active stats guy on TMC tracking SX demand/production. He was the Troy of TMC in its early days, I trust his estimates 100%, we use to call him “”vlad” for short.",,0,0,0,0

They produced a very good hybrid and produced an affordable battery EV a year before Tesla produced barely any volume at all of the model 3. I took a serious look at the Bolt. It's not a bad car at all. But when I asked about charging, I just got a dumb look and essentially the response was ""charging happens"". 

Now they seem to be taking it all more seriously and if they plan to have a bunch of EV models on the road by 2023, they realize they need a significant number of chargers in place by then. Three years is time enough to build a country wide network in the US along with more charging in urban areas to allow apartment dwellers to use EVs. 

I see this as a not unexpected, but serious threat to Tesla. The only real advantage they have is the network of charging stations. Yes, Tesla makes a great car, but for the most part, people aren't really looking for ""great"" cars. There are a dozen other aspects much higher on the list of what people want. Good service is not at the bottom and Tesla is getting a bad rep on that. Price is always important. A physical presence is important to many people. It is also important for the company selling the car to be a significant contender in the market and have some history. Heck, GM employs nearly as many people as the number of model S owners. 

Tesla is a start up who is constantly spawning situations that are reported in a negative light. Tesla barely has stores with many states having no presence at all other than the glowing, red chargers along the highway. Tesla simply has not been visible on the highways long enough for most people to have any confidence in them. 

In other words, other than the cars scattered along the highway, the Tesla charging network is the only visible sign of Tesla's significance to most of the US. This is a branding issue that should not be diminished by the green glow of the competitors.",,0,0,0,0

At the same time, the M3s were sold without the front bracket.

Even though the vehicle was already at the service center, it still took over a week from making payment to get a confirmed delivery date. And multiple phone calls + e-mails. Regardless, the vehicle did look good upon initial presentation. Panel gaps are there, but relatively even, and seems to have been assembled well enough. But there was a deep foot long scratch on the rear passenger door and dust under the paint. The test drive also indicated some minor but prevalent squeaks and pops from the interior. Which appeared to be increasing the more I drove. There is some hidden cheapness you don't experience with vehicles in this price range. 

Combined with many other issues I won't go into again, I decided it was best to walk away. On a positive note, the refund process was seamless and completed in about a week; although BoA was very active in pushing for said refund. 

I will note that I do like Tesla and what they're doing. They're improving, but to be honest, they have a long way to go. I can only suggest that folks continue pushing them in the right direction with unbiased feedback. I'll certainly keep them in mind for my future vehicle purchases.

Interesting info...

Tesla Order Rate Surges 25% Worldwide, 116% In North America, According To New Data | CleanTechnica



It looks to me (and many others here) like a lot of Q1 was pulled into Q4, and now it is back to ""normal""
""

This is bad methodology. As they say:
...this methodology will be flawed and actually overestimate orders for quarters in which Tesla started with a significant backlog of orders (a backlog implies some cars have been ordered but not yet built and therefore not captured in the in-transit numbers). ​
They entered Q3, for example, with a huge backlog that was not part of in transit. They presumably entered Q2 with a SR+ backlog. They also say:
However, Q1 2019 is not such a quarter since there was virtually no backlog from the fourth quarter ​
That's just flat wrong. Europeans placed a ton of Model 3 orders in Q4 that were not included in the 12/31 in transit number. 

I don't see how you can conclude anything one way or the other using this approach. Tesla doesn't define or regularly report orders, so it's nearly impossible to map Elon's 50k against quarterly deliveries in the first place. Does the 50k include Model Y? Why not? Also, there's a surge of orders every time Tesla opens ordering for a new variant or in a new region. Q2 had one mid-sized surge, SR+ in Europe and China, and a couple of small ones such as UK opening for orders. Q1 had a large surge from the 2/28 SR intro and price cuts, plus a mid-sized surge from China and a couple of smaller EU markets opening.

I just don't see how you filter through all this and produce a meaningful conclusion.",,0,0,0,0

It is a pretty good solution. It has a metal pad and bolt that uses heavy duty automotive adhesive to stick to the car. The plate/bracket then screws on with a thumb screw and washer. Looks pretty clean and most importantly for me, if someone runs into the car it won't seriously damage the bumper cover... it can also be removed quickly if I'm detailing the car. 

To permanently remove it would need to heat it up with a heat gun or hairdryer and twist it off but should clean up pretty good. I put the pad where you would never see any residual adhesive anyway and it's glued to a clear bra not paint so not worried about it at all.

As to the ""running without a front plate"". I have done it in the past and I have been stopped for it in the past. It's just one more reason for the cops to stop you.

The relative motion of a moving user terminal on a ground vehicle should be a non issue, especially since they intend to offer it for use on boats and airplanes. The real issue is that there's nowhere nice to put it since it's big and metal would interfere, you'd have to either come up with a way to transparently integrate it into a sunroof or to integrate it into a non-metal body panel (i.e., a plastic/carbon fiber/fiberglass hood or trunk lid), which is doable but not cheap.

Another consideration, probably deserving of a whole new thread, is whether the Tesla Wall Connector for Europe and Australia can charge other non-Tesla vehicles.
""

It can, provided the car adheres to the Mennekes/CC Combo 2 port timings about signals on CP (Proximity) versus CC (Charging). If you toggle the DIP switch that you mustn't toggle (according to the manual) to the ""Legacy"" setting (as per the TWC cover), then it's even more tolerant. Some cars are reported to still have problems, but they're usually the cars for which the TWC brings little profit (compared to charging over a single phase extended Schuko plug at 13A or an EEC plug at 16A).

But regardless of the input configuration it provides power to three phases on its output (my model 3 charges 11kW divided over the three phases, and the input to the TWC also uses 16A on three phases). 

If you want to charge a car with one phase and more than 16A, you can (a Model X will use 25A over three phases), but then the upstream installation also needs to be rated higher (you don't want someone to plug in a Model X when the input is 16A on one phase and you put the output rotary switch to 25A or 32A...)",,0,0,0,0

- No big inventory buildup like in Q1
- About $1B in SG&A + R&D.​

Is that quarterly?
​R&D has been pretty steady at around a billion a year, and will probably stay there. I think it may actually drop a bit from the recent $350 million/quarter as there is only so much R&D you can do at any time, and Models 3/Y/Semi/Pickup don't have high R&D requirements right now.

SG&A, however, is currently $2.2 billion/year, and I expect it to go up to $2.5 - $3 billion as the service centers are deployed geographically.

From the Model X Manual:



Note: When Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is actively slowing down Model X to maintain the selected distance from the vehicle ahead, brake lights turn on to alert other road users that you are slowing down.

I live in CA as well, and when we picked up our MS it had a front plate bracket when I had specifically asked for no bracket. (My ID image was taken in Fremont when we picked up the car.) They said it was required. That bracket was on there to stay! The screws were proprietary and would not come off with any known tool.
""

Unless Tesla very recently changed something, it's not difficult to remove the front plate holder on a post-refresh Model S. You can remove the lower screws with angled needle-nose pliers. After taking off the holder, you'll see a black mounting plate which is glued to the car (just like the Model 3 holder) and can be removed relatively easily using a heat gun.

My build was M3 SR+ Black on white w/18s. Order date was April 27th, and delivered on May 25th. Had a May 2019 build date with HW3. No software update yet for HW3, current version as delivered is still 2019.7.107.

My upgrade list is as follows, and I will document and comment on the following upgrades when completed and any DIY tips as well as where I ordered from:

Wheel/tire upgrade, tint, exterior chrome delete, interior vinyl wraps, mats, and more.

Firstly, since I have new upgraded wheels/tires enroute, I thought I'd share first DIY accessory. M3 has specific jack points to lift car, so instead of purchasing aftermarket lift pads ~60-$80 USD currently, I made my own set of 4 for a total of $23.77 CAD (assuming you have Amazon prime account).

Firstly I ordered following parts that were delivered in 2 days (note these are direct links and not any type of referral links):
https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B000PWU9CC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1

You come up with the heating method that can take a large amount of electricity and turn it into a bunch of heat in 2-5seconds in a cost effective manner and I bet Musk will hire you.

Heating elements don't do well with a cycle of a few seconds.

Far as using the motor, to make the heat that fast if they could I think they would.

Stop and think about it for a second Regen can hit what 60kw the S/X heater is 6kw to dump that kind of every into the coolant in a few seconds of Regen you will boil the coolant at the point of heating however it is accomplished.

Every engineering dilema is simple to fix when you don't stop to think about the physics involved.
""

Of course dumping 60kW into the coolant at once is not a good idea, but atleast where I live I have a lot off hills that would heat the battery for several minutes each time. Driving back my kids from school generates 300W-500W on they way back and 10kW of regen is enough to not touch brakes. When we go to the moutains several times in the winter we often regen 2-3kW going downhill.",,0,0,0,0

Is that quarterly?
​R&D has been pretty steady at around a billion a year, and will probably stay there. I think it may actually drop a bit from the recent $350 million/quarter as there is only so much R&D you can do at any time, and Models 3/Y/Semi/Pickup don't have high R&D requirements right now.

SG&A, however, is currently $2.2 billion/year, and I expect it to go up to $2.5 - $3 billion as the service centers are deployed geographically.

That would be a total of about $4 billion/year or $1/billion a quarter for R&D + SG&A. Is that the same as your estimate?​
""

Yes, all quarterly. Last 5 quarters R&D + SG&A has been around $1B/quarter. Probably longer - I've not checked.

Shouldn't most of the increase in service go to Service Cost ? That is definitely one item that has been increasing and I think will continue to increase. I don't know how they treat rent/lease on facilities for service center - whether that goes to SG&A or Service Cost or if its shared some kind of allocation.

R&D - Most of that cost is probably people. I expect Tesla to continue to hire more engineers for FSD and software - even as may be few are let go on the manufacturing side. Even so, generally Tesla wouldn't let a lot of manufacturing R&D engineers to go - may be only the ones they don't like - because it would be difficult to hire back good talent.

I encountered some ground loop issues I encountered when powering the GoPro off the USB port on the car but having the HDMI go into a laptop that also had an analog audio signal from the sound board which resulted in a wonderful buzzing noise. I resolved it by powering it off the inverter as well. Total average wattage stayed around 200 watts and we ran everything from the single 450 watt max inverter as a result of the other inverter I had failing.

The signal booster worked wonders. It can't invent signal out of thin air when there isn't one but it certainly helped us to stay connected in sections I thought for certain we would drop. We had some losses during mountain passes as expected but overall I was very pleased with the performance.

Some of the most interesting things that happened were related to autopilot handling, especially around how TheAxeMan (the other person going with me) reacted to learning how to keep it happy.

Goedenavond!
Lees al een tijdje mee op het forum. Ik ben in het proces van het bestellen van een tweetal LR AWD M3’s. Een lease en een koop. De lease variant is door ons eind april besteld. De tweede bestel ik binnenkort.
Nu beweert de leasemij dat de levertijd waarschijnlijk eind Augustus is. Iets wat mij sterk lijkt voor een standaard zwarte auto. Wat zijn hier een beetje de levertijden geweest van recente bestellingen? Ik heb het gevoel dat de leasemij de auto nog niet eens besteld heeft.

Als je al een tijdje meeleest dan weet je inmiddels dat er niks over te zeggen is.

Sommige mensen rijden binnen een week andere wachten sinds februari en er zijn gevallen bekend van mensen die al maanden op een lijst staan terwijl andere (met dezelfde configuratie) binnen een paar weken rijden.

Het beste kan je onderstaande lijst invullen:

Toen ik dat in Maart deed kwam er 23-05 uit. Uiteindelijk is het 05-06 geworden. Voor mij was het ook een lease en ik kan je vertellen de leasemaatschappij heeft er echt niks mee te maken.

We paid peak retail 

I’m mad in the fact this group is being overlooked/ignored by Tesla.
""




I am in the group that paid peak retail for no AP LR RWD too (In fact, we got two - his and hers.) I don't feel overlooked at all. Let's look at the facts: 

When I ordered, EAP was a $5k option and FSD $3k for a total of $8k at purchase. The order page informed me that I would be able to get those options after purchase for $6k and $4k respectively for a total of $10k. I made the decision not to buy these options at purchase based on that information, thinking (mistakenly) that at anytime for the life of the car I could purchase at the $10k price. 
Shortly after, the post-purchase price for AP/FSD went up, giving me a tinge of regret. 
We then each had the 30 day trial with the option to purchase EAP for $5.5k, which we also declined. 
I lost track of all of the variations in between, but as others have stated, we had the opportunity at one point to buy AP for $2k and FSD for $3k. This was $3k less than the at-purchase option and half the cost of the $10k I originally expected. (Still I didn't buy it - used the event to justify buying wider, lighter wheels, 200 treadwear tires and a BBK.) My wife did take advantage of the $2k AP on her car as she likes the TACC.
As of today, if I decided to add the option, I could get AP for $3k and FSD for $6k, which is still $1k less than what I was told it would cost to add it when I ordered. 
Seems to me, I'm in a better position and Tesla has exceeded my expectations.

Oh, but I still have a complaint - Why can't an appropriate version of Track Mode be made available for non-P cars? I'd gladly pay up to have it as an option!",,0,0,0,0

Until then this is all talk and the car needs to leave me alone when I'm driving.

Rejecting a car that removes 95% of all the stuff you have to be constantly alert of in every other car on the market just because it temporarily has its own small unique thing to be aware of is indeed completely out of proportion.

Some people are desperate to be relieved of the burden of driving. I'm not one of them. I want a Model 3 because it's clean, it seems like an awesome car to drive, autopilot will be a plus in heavy traffic. Removing 95% of what I have to be aware of while driving is not a selling point for me.

Features These Autopilot safety features are available on all Model 3 vehicles: • Lane Assist (see Lane Assist on page 84). • Collision Avoidance Assist (see Collision Avoidance Assist on page 86). • Speed Assist (see Speed Assist on page 89). • Auto High Beam (see High Beam Headlights on page 48). These convenience features, designed to reduce driver workload, are available only if your Tesla vehicle is equipped with the optional Enhanced Autopilot or Full SelfDriving Capability packages: • Traffic-Aware Cruise Control (see TrafficAware Cruise Control on page 67). • Autosteer (see Autosteer on page 73).

I think it is telling us total gasoline sales.

California has in the last few years been importing gasoline from Nevada, Washington, and British Columbia.

But I did not read that as being only California refineries. California gets data from taxes being paid, out of State refiners also pay taxes.

I disagree. EIA measures consumption by ""product supplied"". I couldn't find CA product supplied, but here is product supplied for PADD5 which is dominated by CA (plus AK, WA, OR, NV, AZ and HI). Note that it does not show a dramatic decline over the past decade. Now look at your metric, retail gasoline sales by refiners, for PADD 5. It does show the dramatic decline.

I'm too lazy to research it, but I think retail sales by refiners only applies to gas stations owned by companies with refineries.

The dragging part before total failure is interesting.

Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I think this is a 3 phase induction motor. I think there are three things I can think of that might cause dragging. 1) a bearing failure. 2) A winding failure. 3) An inverter partial failure. I've seen the first 2 occur in motors and the last one in a power inverter.

We've all probably seen a bearing failure. I'm thinking noise at first. Then as it starts to cease up motor drag and overheating, and finally possible gear failure as ball bearings go flying out.

As for a winding failure I had a table saw motor fail that way. It behaved very strangely until it finally failed for good. I first suspected the soft start motor controller, but after replacing that component it didn't fix the problem. Only replacing the motor's induction windings fixed the problem which surprised me as being a rare thing to fail. The defect in the end turned out to be improper and inadiquite physical support and wrapping of the windings to support the physical forces of starting up and running a heavy blade, i.e. the wires that produce the high magnetic fields were bending back and forth with the AC current. Normally motor windings are tightly wrapped to each other, or to some sort of frame to keep them motionless, i.e. from vibrating and/or thus bending with each cycle of the current.

In order to produce the huge amounts of torque in the Tesla, tremendous physical forces are put on the wires generating that force. This can cause tiny physical motion in these wires, and the motion in time can wear off parts of the wire-to-wire insulation, thus causing shorts between loops. This won't stall the motor completely, but will cause it to loose power, heat more and vibrate more. At first only one phase would be affected.

Normally in a three phase motor constant torque is produced so there is very little vibration in the rotor. But because you will have at least 3 separate windings, if one of them has a short between wire loops it will cause vibration in the torque output and excess heating, and roughness as the short at first can come and go with force. And this could cause additional issues like early bearing failure, and/or other windings to in time fail.

In the case of my table saw motor failure, Bosch had not properly wraped and glued the windings tightly to each other leaving them to vibrate somewhat with with the ac current. The damage didn't show up for a couple of years.

Finally if one of the three power supplies (choppers) partially fails, this would also cause torque vibration, as one of the phases would not be balanced with the other two. I don't know how their switching electronics is designed, but I'm guessing that for each phase there are paralleled power components (think paralleled transistor switches, though the silicon is much more advanced than that, probably using some sort of a FET (Field Effect Transistor)) in order to get the high power needed. (Someone please fill me in if you know how this is actually done.) From my experience repairing hundreds of heavy power supplies for main frames years ago, I imagine that if one of those switches fails, that the overall switch might be able to keep working, but not smoothly.
""

Front motor is a three phase induction motor. 

But this is a rear drive unit failure - the permanent magnet switched reluctance motor. That changes things quite a bit I'd think.",,0,0,0,0

Also note that if the estimates quoted below are correct, then the ICE taxes in Norway are not punitive, they simply charge the true cost of an ICE car, which is more than the car's purchase price:



I.e.:

average estimated life time health damage caused by gasoline cars with U.S. pricing = ~$134,000
average life time health damage caused by diesel cars with U.S. pricing = ~$170,000

Which means that for Norway it's common sense to severely restrict and then ban ICE cars, just like it's common-sense to charge more for radioactive fuel, to cover the rod removal and safe long term nuclear waste storage costs - which clean-up costs wind and solar energy does not have.

Except that for ICE cars the waste is currently emitted straight into the atmosphere, ""for free"", in a free-loading fashion, causing various sorts of damage - hence the mis-pricing.

There's no more freeloading for the ICE industry in Norway.
""

Well, given your numbers for the health damage = $134k, what Norway charges is in no way equals ""no more freeloading""

If you look at those taxes, majority is 25% VAT(value added tax), which obviously got a temp waiver for EVs to help them enter the market, but at some point in the future will be applied to EVs as well. It gets applied to Tesla sales in EU(19% VAT).
Then weight tax, will be added too for EVs in the future.



VW Golf
Import price: $21,500
CO2 tax: $3,750
NOx tax: $260
Weight tax: $2,500
Value-added tax: $7,000
Total retail cost: $35,000 (all other fees included)

VW e-Golf
Import price: $30,590
CO2 tax: $0 (tailpipe-based)
NOx tax: $0 (tailpipe-based)
Weight tax: $0 (exempt)
Value-added tax: $0 (exempt)

""

Why Norway leads the world in electric vehicle adoption

What they are charging for pollution is a mere $4k on a $21.5k car. Not anywhere near $134k.
Still looks like a freeloading.
The rest is a temp EV incentive.

Volkswagen AG is making changes to its battery-purchasing plan worth about 50 billion euros ($56 billion) over concerns one if its supply deals, with Samsung SDI Co. Ltd., might unravel, according to people familiar with the matter.

Samsung initially agreed to deliver batteries for just over 20 gigawatt hours, enough to power 200,000 cars with 100 kilowatt hour packs, before different views on production volume and schedule emerged during detailed negotiations, said the people, who asked not to be identified as the talks are confidential.

I've increasingly thought that Tesla might be better focusing on driving 100% of the time on 60% of the roads rather than driving 60% of the time on 100% of the roads. By that I mean I would much prefer the car to be reliably left to drive on good quality freeways with low complexity and push for full autonomy on those conditions and take on the regulators to get permission to have the car responsible so I can work in the car and not need to concentrate, than have the car trying to drive in city areas and turn in junctions and stop at stop signs etc. The benefit for me on a 3 hour drive to let the car do ALL the driving for 2 hours of that journey would be amazing even if I had to drive the remaining hour without any aid and much better than having to pay attention for all 3 hours.
""

From investment angle, I definitely want Tesla to concentrate and get the NOA on city streets. Then, they can concentrate on getting everything done better - being able to recognize objects better, for eg., will help in both city & freeways. ​",,0,0,0,0

Rain is not a problem.

Anecdotally - I was charging my car once during a pretty crazy thunderstorm. We had a lightning strike very close to the house that caused a power surge and outage. Right after that happened, my car's cooling fans started spinning at a thousand miles an hour and didn't quit until I disconnected the charger and rebooted the MCU.

Nothing seems to have been damaged, this was tens of thousands of miles ago, but since that happened I generally go unplug the car from shore power if there's a thunderstorm in the area.

Yes, the main issue with feel for me occurs in situations where regen influence is diminished. This could be in situations when regen is lessened for whatever reason, or sudden slowing at higher speeds when the brakes are the dominant contributor to braking torque.

I'm dismayed that these false-alarm reports keep coming. Why aren't people remembering to disable ELDA when they get in the car? I have an AP2 MS, so ELDA is not included in 16.2, but if an upgrade brings it to me in present form, I'll sure as hell not forget to disable it before driving. It should be part of the ritual of buckling up and checking the mirrors before putting the car in gear.
""

It's starting to become 2nd nature for me to turn it off, but it's still annoying to do every single drive: tap car icon, tap autopilot, scroll down, tap ELDA toggle, click disable on confirm popup, close menu.

I think to the minds at Tesla, they feel they have a unique product feature in the minimalist styling. I think they have a driver distraction feature that diverts the driver's eyes further from the road than just glancing down to the dash.

There is no game to the system with SRP and to be honest I doubt Sun Valley vs Tesla would be much of a difference. It’s pretty upfront in SRP territory on what to expect if you do your homework.

Tesla is rejiggering its Fremont factory to build the Model Y SUV and a Model S refresh

Wow! This is a serious cost cutting move. It's also interesting that they are refreshing the model S but not the model X. It would seem a bit odd to continue stuffing the old tech in the model X after they have updated the S especially with the combined assembly lines. 

This should save a bunch of money compared to building another entire line somewhere else. It will also keep the model Y and model 3 production together which will be a significant benefit given the large number of common parts.

I agree, I like the dash of the current X. I expect the model 3 dash is cheaper to produce, but the model S and X aren't about being cheap. The reality is these cars don't cost a lot more to make than the model 3 considering they are twice the price. 

I think to the minds at Tesla, they feel they have a unique product feature in the minimalist styling. I think they have a driver distraction feature that diverts the driver's eyes further from the road than just glancing down to the dash. 

I didn't see anything about new motors like the model 3, but this report does mention a longer range battery. That would be appreciated I think. 350 mile rated range would be great! I certainly hope they refresh the model X with that. It sure could use it.

The PSAs here are that a) Michelin treadwear warranties do not apply to OEM tires 2) Tesla will not cover the tires under the treadwear warranty 3) call Michelin directly to see if they can help 4) if you get aftermarket tires, make sure you rotate them (and get receipts) every 6,000-8,000 miles.

After a couple of calls to Michelin, getting friendly people to help, and going to a local authorized Michelin retailer, I was able to get my tires covered at 50%.

I learned that OEM tires are generally made with inferior rubber than the exact same aftermarket tires, so OEM tires generally last much shorter than rated.

I had considered the Michelin CrossClimate+ as a replacement and my tire shop warned me they would be super-loud with the tread that looks similar to the discontinued Goodyear Aquatred. I am going with Michelin Premier A/S tires as recommended by the retailer. He said it was the best balance of performance handling, noise and treadwear. He said the Primacy MXM4 were sh*t tires. Given he is not making money of the sales of the new ones and is recommending cheaper tires, I have to believe he is being honest. Neither was in stock.

Perhaps connectors have changed shape or the physical dimensions of the MCU have changed.

One other comment I made -- I'll make in case, since somebody asked this explicitly. For Model Y production, we are right now trying to decide whether Model Y vehicle production should be in California or Nevada. And we expect to make a final decision on that very soon. But in the meantime, we've ordered all of the tooling and equipment required for Model Y. So, we do not expect this to in anyway delay production of Model Y. But it's currently a very close call between Nevada and California as to whether we do the Model Y at Giga or at Fremont, but those are the two options.

I'd take the entire article with a big grain of salt.

Specific details, dates, models etc could all be wrong. Specific employees may know a lot, a little or nothing at all.

Ofcourse it makes sense to build 3/Y together - and for X/Y to have the same line.

I'd take everything else as speculative.
""

Don't follow your thinking about the S/X line sharing ""makes sense"". The S and X may have a few parts in common, but the assembly is not so much alike. They aren't going to be mixed on the line, they are going to time share the line. In other words, they are going to make model S cars for a week or two, shut down the line and then make model X cars for a week or two. At the beginning this will be a disaster but after some weeks or months the bugs will get worked out. 

The only reason they are considering this is to make space to add model Y production. Even building the model Y and X in the same plant is only a small advantage. They don't need to stock as much inventory since much is shared. They are putting them both in the same place to avoid the large costs of setting up a new plant.",,0,0,0,0

There was no setting in 8.5. Nothing to turn on or off, this was just happening with no explanation. LDA and ELDA supposedly didn't exist in 8.5, but there it is.

Read the release notes: LDA shows a blue line when it does a steering correction. ELDA shows a red line when it does a steering correction.

The behavior people are experiencing in 16.2 is quite different than your video and what you describe for 8.5. There were lane departure warnings (which could be turned off) in 8.5, and your referenced video is specifically for a feature intended to mitigate ""mode confusion"" issues. 

In 16.2, presumably the things you mention still exist, but there are additional features as well (of note, the ELDA which has to be turned off for every drive). Note, I don't have 16.2, but I know it is new to 16.2 because the announcement from Tesla of the new features came substantially AFTER release of version 8 (and I think also after release of version 12).

Who told you automation was the point? I thought emissionless driving was the point? Or a superior propulsion technology and better driving experience?

I'm looking forward to playing with autopilot in traffic, and someday a long time from now when I can literally get in the car, buckle my seatbelt, and say ""Ok, Tesla, take me to ______"" and then open up a paperback, I will be enthusiastically on board. Until then this is all talk and the car needs to leave me alone when I'm driving.



Some people are desperate to be relieved of the burden of driving. I'm not one of them. I want a Model 3 because it's clean, it seems like an awesome car to drive, autopilot will be a plus in heavy traffic. Removing 95% of what I have to be aware of while driving is not a selling point for me. 

Also, again, nothing indicates this is temporary.



Considering that I can reject the car for any reason up to and including ""the fart noises weren't accurate enough"" for a week after delivery, I don't think that will be an issue.

And again, if I KNEW Tesla was ever going to allow this to be permanently disabled, I wouldn't be worried. But I don't and neither do you.
""

I don't think you're ready for this car. For all we know, they're forcing something here in order to get data needed to make things safer, or testing the public on preference... I'm OK with this noise, but you are clearly not. This is all Beta stuff, changing VERY fast, and anyone using Beta software has to have some level of acceptance. This is necessary for Tesla to win. But saying ""I'm not buying the car until this glitch is taken care of..."" sounds like ""I reject this milkshake because there's no cherrie on top."" I know, not the same here, just how it sounds.

No disrespect, but this car is not for your type. You'll likely complaint until eternity on the changes taking place now and for the next several years. The only time I've seen Tesla change something from complaints is when it was truly a great idea or, in the case of Model S and rear camera persistence, EVERY OWNER complains on that one item and starts legal proceedings. Complaining on this will have little to no effect unless you have a strong case and a large following. Cancelling your order will also have no affect. 

FYI, we are here for different reasons. Myself, I DID NOT buy this car to save the planet, I just want to be a part of the automation wave, and the economics made sense for us. (However, when you walk the walk long enough, the planet becomes part of your thinking like holding the stupid hand-rail at work. You also begin to hate big oil and the stock market manipulators.)

As with any other report sourced from anonymous reports - whether by CNBC on Tesla, WaPo on the White House or Axios on Mueller report - we have to look for corroborative reporting from others. We have to see how much they agree or disagree with what we already know.

More over may be what the employee said/meant was that equipment and tooling has just started arriving and the CNBC reporter doesn't understand the significant different between order and delivery.

The report didn't say ""assembly line workers"", it simply said ""current and former employees"". 

When upper management says ""we've ordered all of the tooling and equipment"" it doesn't necessarily mean the POs have been sent.

I know, I get POs all the time and there is often a significant delay from the time my contact says they are sending a PO and I receive it.

So I have been cruising the used Model S listings for a few weeks now. And I've noticed that there are at least 10 Model S Long Range, 2017s and 2018s, with mileage on them, that are listed for as much as, or more than the cost of a brand new one. Can anyone explain why this is so? For example: $75000 for a 2017 with 17k miles and EAP vs. a 2019 with 50 miles and AP for $77000. Is the value of EAP vs AP that great? Several of the 2017s have been lingering unsold for a while and I wonder if it's because of the price being too close to new.

Will the prices of these 2017s eventually drop farther from new? Does Tesla keep these priced high to push sales of new ones? Any of you more experienced price-watchers have insight? Thank you.

Don't follow your thinking about the S/X line sharing ""makes sense"". The S and X may have a few parts in common, but the assembly is not so much alike. They aren't going to be mixed on the line, they are going to time share the line. In other words, they are going to make model S cars for a week or two, shut down the line and then make model X cars for a week or two. At the beginning this will be a disaster but after some weeks or months the bugs will get worked out. 

The only reason they are considering this is to make space to add model Y production. Even building the model Y and X in the same plant is only a small advantage. They don't need to stock as much inventory since much is shared. They are putting them both in the same place to avoid the large costs of setting up a new plant.

Sorry, je bent verkeerd of niet geïnformeerd.

Dus ik heb tot op de dag van vandaag niet gekregen waar ik voor betaald heb. Zo simpel is het. Regelmatig worden er auto's met kabel afgeleverd. Dus kennelijk zijn er regelmatig kabels beschikbaar.

I don't care about ""most"" people. Many people want and enjoy higher amperage home charging, including myself. Especially now with paid supercharging that's 50% more expensive, why the hell would I want to supercharge? If nothing else, it clogs up the supercharger network.

CCS and chademo are irrelevant in the US, and would be irrelevant in Canada too if Tesla would simply build it's supercharger network. But this is an ENTIRELY different topic, you're just trying to distract from the reduction in functionality for everyday use.

Don't follow your thinking about the S/X line sharing ""makes sense"". The S and X may have a few parts in common, but the assembly is not so much alike. They aren't going to be mixed on the line, they are going to time share the line. In other words, they are going to make model S cars for a week or two, shut down the line and then make model X cars for a week or two. At the beginning this will be a disaster but after some weeks or months the bugs will get worked out.
""

Product mix is not a new thing, they can build in smaller than two week batches without needing to shut down the line. A lot of the assembly happens off the main line: power train, doors, IP, then those modules get installed. Could even use all the original tooling and set up the S and X stations sequentially.




gnuarm said:

I wonder how much of that equipment they will be returning? If they are freeing up the model X assembly line there will be a lot of equipment to spare.
""

Likely none, S and X general assembly is mostly manual with the chassis carries on autonomous carts. Any fixturing would not carry over to the Y.

We're talking custom order long lead items, not off the shelf. From the Q1 call quote I posted: ""So, we do not expect this to in anyway delay production of Model Y.""
Delivery location is not needed until the tooling is completed, and the cost can be adjusted at that point.

AHD refers to the Analog High Definition, it's developed by a Korean Company - Nextchip. The advantage of this technology is that the HD video (from 720p30 to [email protected] can be carried / transmitted thru the normal AV cable (widely named as CVBS / RCA). This kind of technology has been widely used in the surveillance product, also the dash cam (with front and rear camera with recording function).

Why using AHD instead of HDMI for those 3 cameras, it is all about the cable, HDMI cable is thick and very signal sensitive, also relatively expensive. HDMI cable is not a good idea for routing from side cameras to the center console.

Can you provide a link of when such bearings have been replaced by Tesla and the price of such a repair?
Quite often if a bearing goes, a lot can go with it. Depends on how early it's caught.

I agree, the Model 3 is nicely designed to ""swap"" out the Inverter etc. Because everything except the motor and battery are on a large complex modular sub assembly. That piece would probably cost $10k or more to ""buy new retail"". However, what they may likely do is swap in a refurb and get the old one refurbed on the bench. That is what they are doing on battery warranties. They don't give you a new battery. They give you a refurb.

A Tesla Model S door handle is a $1000, what do think Tesla would charge for the drive electrons module? Even if it was a swap for refurb?

Fact is, nothing is cheap about Tesla's. And we really have no idea what the costs will be long term or the reliability. Model S/X certainly have seen bright spots and dark spots. We all hope the Model 3 will be better.

A friend has a 2014 Model S with 120K miles. He has spent $10k in repairs. 3 Door Handles ($1K each), Main Display ($3K), Emergency Brake Caliper Seized ($1.3K) etc. He was dumb not to get extended warranty and still loves the car and will buy another but he WILL buy the extended warranty next time. He is on his 3rd Drive unit (covered under warranty) !! How many ICE car owners do you personally know of with it's 3rd engine? He'd be out of Warranty on a Model 3 now.

I have not spent $10K in repairs in the last 20 years on two family cars 600K+ miles (ran two over 200K). I always get extended warranty. My Jeep has unlimited miles lifetime warranty for $2500 ($100 deductible). P.S. I have not made a single claim on any of the extended warranties. They never broke. Ugh.

I bought the car knowing all this going in. No need to sugar coat it.

There are two sealed bearing that support the rotor. Just like in any electric motor ever made these have a duty cycle and service life. Tesla has switched to ceramic as they were having failures, which will makes itself know with growling and vibration. Ignore that for to long and they will seize to the shaft or fly to bits or both. The tiny amount of grease they contain is all they ever get. I have popped the seals off ceramic bearings to renew grease however.
Ceramic bearings life a long life in a dust free high rpm low load environment (lots of drone engines have these). I've serviced a lot of very large motors so how long they will last is anyone's guess. I would think they should go 200,000-300,000 km. Probably worth $30 each.",,0,0,0,0

I never saw anything that showed the underbody shields were missing from the cars, 2?, that were reported to have their rear bumper covers ripped off by going through a ""puddle"".
""

It’s true; it is possible that the underbody shields being missing is not a necessary condition for loss of the bumper cover. However, the ones I saw were reported to be lost in rain...so it makes you wonder how it happened.

As I noted elsewhere, the cars that lost their bumper covers notably had weak spot welds on the rear brackets (it’s extremely obvious from the pictures - the brackets are missing!). For sure those welds were weak (weaker than the bumper cover plastic anyway). It’s possible those brackets simply detached and the bumper covers fell off, unrelated to water. However, I’ve taken off the bumper cover, and there are enough other attachment points that I am not sure those weld failures by themselves would result in bumper cover loss (though it would not be good).

So, considering all the evidence, and GUESSING, I would guess it was a combination of large amounts of water intrusion into the rear bumper cover (and can’t see how that would happen without a damaged or missing (which is not a one-off thing, surprisingly enough) aero shield), and weak welds on those brackets (the bracket welds being weak hurt because it is the loss of two attachment points)...though even if the bracket welds were super strong there would have presumably been massive bumper cover damage...

Basically I just can’t see how you could lose a bumper cover unless:

1) The aero shield is missing so allows hundreds of pounds of water to be scooped in a deep puddle 

OR:

2) At least 6 of the ~8 attachment bolts of the rear bumper cover were missing. (I think you could lose it if this happened even if the aero cover were installed). 

Since the brackets were gone on the missing bumper cover vehicles, I have to assume those associated bolts WERE present.

I’ll try to avoid my more dry sense of humor in future.",,0,0,0,0

With the generation rate plan this will occur by minimizing peak usage and demand charges while not overpaying for excess production and/or storage.

My reference to Sun Valley wasn’t intended to induce price shopping or brand recommendations. I simply noted what I have and who installed it. 

My recommendation for members to be careful was in light of recommendations by Tesla for systems that make no economic sense given the SRP rate plans (i.e.excess solar panels and multiple PWs which will result in poor ROI performance). I agree people should do their homework and I would encourage part of that homework to include consultation with multiple industry experts including those with experience with the SRP. Then buy from whomever provides the most perceived value (to include price point, warranty, service, etc). 

People should also be careful regarding the new solar rate plans. If you review the new plan documentation, the SRP has tweaked the rates, demand charges and/or reduced credit for energy sold back to the grid to ensure they, on average, have the same revenue regardless which plan users choose. For me and my system, the E-27 plan works best as I have low (currently negative) peak grid draw and near zero peak demand. Grid rates (especially off-peak) are very cheap on the plan.",,0,0,0,0

Those demand charges are steep as I read. Can't recall which station but they are adding battery storage to level out the consumption. Does the above station installation price estimate include some storage? Once everyone goes to high speed charging this will be a must, specially with the V3's 5 minute high power.

Other topic: there will be a massive investment in the electricity network during the transitioning to renewable sources. This will be reflected in the electricity prices. Also there might be additional tax on it (to cover the road/infrastructure maintenance costs). I don't know how that affects the operators' profit.

sorka said:

No more noisy bushings. I used an 18 gauge grease needle to inject silicon grease between the bushing and the sway bar. This required unbolting the bushing bracket and spreading it apart far enough to allow the needle to be squeezed in between the rubber and the sway bar.

One trick is to push on the needle gentle as you squirt the grease under pressure. This expands the rubber from the sway bar just slightly and allows the needle to slide in all the way.

I tried to get it all the way around but when I got it back together, the problem was actually worse. Rather than 1 or two pops from the rubber finally having too much rotational shear and settling to a lower energy state, it was now creaking badly. i.e. the bushing was now sliding more readily around the bar as the bar rotated but was still sticking enough to cause noise.

This was two weeks ago. Slowly but surely the noise squeak got quieter and quieter and finally vanished. I did both bushings and they are now completely quiet.

If anyone is interested, let me know and I'll post photos.

TLDR: It's not really theft and definitely not illegal to do, but also kinda obviously morally wrong. And nothing at all is stopping Tesla from clamping down on this. If nothing else, they could initiate a periodic check on each car where the mothership checks that the car's configuration is sane(i.e. matches what their side indicates it should have) and locks several features on the car for ""safety reasons""(e.g. if battery is unlocked but doesn't show as having been on their side, they could disable Supercharger access to protect the battery). People could sue, but good luck proving that Tesla shouldn't view your rooting and modifying the software as being potentially damaging to those functions.

Hacking software (or hardware for that matter) in order to get/steal functions that you would be required to pay for is called theft of service (in the US).

3702198,Model 3 SR+ Accessories: Vancouver,matt-lm,2019-05-29 11:43:00,"Ideally strictly for looks, 20s would be ideal to put on a M3 assuming you can give a little up in ride comfort. The factory 19s are a $2k CAD option I chose to forgo and spend the money on an aftermarket set. Also I did not want to negatively affect range (since have smaller SR+ battery pack) and give up too much ride comfort, so I chose to go with 19s. So a couple important factors to consider when selecting aftermarket wheels for range consideration is unsprung weight (ie. want the lightest wheel/tire combination possible) and also tire rolling resistance, and last but not least is looks.

Factory Aero wheels with covers weigh 23lbs (without covers 21.6lbs) + factory Michelin Primacy MXM4 tires 25lbs = 48 lbs each.
(Side note: Factory 19"" wheels are 25lbs, factory tires 23lbs = 48 lbs each)

So the target was to stay close to the factory 48lbs!

For tire weights, you can go to a tire manufacturer's website to find specific tire weights or use tiresize.com.

Now typically when increasing wheel diameter the wheel and tire weights will increase. A lot of lower cost wheels are cast, so you get good $ value but you pay in wheel weight. If you have a bigger budget, you can choose lightweight wheel options that are manufactured with different tech such as forging with exotic metals which will allow you to get larger diameter wheels that are much lighter. Forged wheels are considerably more $$$ than standard cast wheels $, so you pay for the weight savings. My budget did not allow for fully forged wheels, instead I chose flow forged wheels which is a newer tech that gets you some weight savings without the large wallet damage $$.

I chose Tsportline flow forged 19s which are made specifically for Tesla and have correct offset etc. and utilize factory lugnuts too. List price starts @ 1660-1760USD-for a set (depending on finish), but they have sales a few times are year where they offer 10-20% discount and free shipping to US/Canada. I happened to purchase on Memorial Day weekend sale and got em for $1584 USD shipped to my YVR door.

For tires, the criteria was to find quality 'Eco' tires (low rolling resistance) that have very low road noise with good handling. After doing extensive research I chose Pirelli P7 All Season Plus. I've had Pirelli's any many cars, and always happy with them. There were some other new quiet Eco tires released such as Bridgestone Turanza Quiettrack, but the 28lb weight was not appealing. Tire rack is good website for tire info.
https://www.tirerack.com/tires/tires.jsp?tireMake=Pirelli&tireModel=Cinturato+P7+All+Season+Plus&partnum=34VR9CP7ASPXL&vehicleSearch=false&fromCompare1=yes

Final setup - wheels 23.7lbs + tires 25'lbs = 48.7 lbs. Very close to factory 18s.

Now so far in performance (~200km driven so far).....and handling is fantastic and in my opinion road noise is slightly quieter than factory Aero 18s which have Michelin Primacy MXM4 tires. Range effects TBD...

Hi guys, sorry for the delayed response.

Yes, got delivery of my model S that day!
My flight was very late, like 3 hours. Even though, I called the tesla at paramus and they were super understanding.
When I got there, it took only about 20 minutes to drive away with my Tesla.
The delivery was rushed and I also was in a rush, so didn't look well at the car. As soon as I stopped to charge I started noticing some dents in the interior and also lots of swirling on the paint (maybe from past cleaning jobs). I took some videos of that after getting out of tesla, but really dont know if I can ask for repairs or anything.
I drove from New York to Florida very smoothly. Only my MCU was resetting all the time, erasing my info and turning off autopilot. Though, as soon as I updated my system the problem disappeared.

There are my pictures of the car and also I would like to know if I argue with tesla or not. Thank you guys for the support!

These are all solvable with resisitive heating . Same principle as seat heaters, but integrate the wire into the battery. It's just added cost.
""

No, it's not. Seat heaters (and even the car heating) are much lower amounts of current, by an order of magnitude than what is required to physically brake a car. You're talking about switching the regen typically going to a pack for battery to resistive coils, which means power on the order of 50-100kW. Assuming you could equally distribute it properly, you then need to be able to modulate and switch it. It's a pretty big redesign of the existing inverter, since now you have two paths that have to be switched independently (and probably need to operate simultaneously for most efficiency).

I'm not saying it isn't possible, I'm sure Tesla has actually investigated this to some extent already. I'm just saying that it's a pretty big redesign and cost adder. A lot simpler than just adding a heating coil to car seats or something.",,0,0,0,0

Since 2011 the car has been on Tesla's Unsupported List, so no over-the-air updates, no supercharging (although the Roadster can’t supercharge anyway), and no maintenance at a SC. I had started the process of getting the car removed from the Unsupported List: having it inspected by a certified body shop; having the high-voltage system checked at a SC; and then shipping the paperwork to corporate and waiting for them to decide if they will support it again or not. However the SC in Jacksonville, FL told me there is no need for that any longer. The Service Manager said Tesla recently changed their policy and the SCs have the discretion to repair unsupported cars. He explained that Tesla will never remove the car from the Unsupported List, but he is able (and willing) to provide maintenance. In fact, my car is there now getting faults cleared, required service, and minor repairs / component replacement.

Given the facts that the Roadster never could supercharge and that Tesla quit sending over-the-air updates to the Roadsters a couple of years ago (not sure exactly when this was) what does the Unsupported List mean if a local SC will maintain the car?

I disagree. EIA measures consumption by ""product supplied"". I couldn't find CA product supplied, but here is product supplied for PADD5 which is dominated by CA (plus AK, WA, OR, NV, AZ and HI). Note that it does not show a dramatic decline over the past decade. Now look at your metric, retail gasoline sales by refiners, for PADD 5. It does show the dramatic decline.

I'm too lazy to research it, but I think retail sales by refiners only applies to gas stations owned by companies with refineries. Shell, Chevon, Exxon, etc. That used to be the norm, but these days there is much less vertical integration. Even a lot of branded stations are independently owned and may or may not count as ""retail sales by refiners"".

I don't know what the breakout of the resales mean, but it seems to support your thought. What's interesting is the historical data for the resales still shows a ~4,000 thousand-gallons-per-day reduction over the same 5 years.

California consumes its own blend of gasoline during the summer months to help fight smog. So the refinerer resales should still represent statewide consumption, which is trending down significantly.

How long you can GET AWAY WITH ignoring the instructions before the car will notice (15-60 seconds depending on conditions usually)


I mean you'd agree a car with NO driver assists you should always keep your hands on the wheel, right? Yet if your alignment is good on a straight/flat road, you can ""get away with"" not doing so for at least as long as APs warning checks.

That doesn't mean it's correct or safe operation of the car.

Hi All-
I had an auto shop install the DrawTire hitch on my 2014 Model S. 
However, they removed the long cross bar (?) that was on the car during the installation. Is that normal? 
I asked them if it was safe for the kids in the Rear Facing Seats without that cross bar, 
and they said that it should be fine and tow receive should provide protection. 
They also said that the instructions specifically call from the removal of the Tesla crossbar.

i've been tracking my usage more lately to see if my degredation is normal. i dont think it is but i keep mentioning it to Tesla and they say it is.

for example, last week one trip from 100% (235 miles) to 27% (65 miles) used 45.8kWh. So 73% of usage was 45.8kWh...
and again last week, from 100% to 13% used 53.2 kWh.
and again from 54% to 19% used 21.9kWh.

I still use on average about 30% more range than rated to get to my destination. It's always been that way.

anyway, calculating out those numbers above, it would seem my ""Usable 100%"" is about 62kWh, which is far below what an 85kW pack should be. Sure I get that only 77kW is usable on an 85kW pack, but still, every trip i make calculates to about the same around ~61kW usable in my pack. Last time I went from 100% to about 4% it used around 58 or 59 kW but that was about a year ago I think. Still works out to be the same. I never take it that low anymore though.

Lease buy outs, as a rule, tend to be not good deals. First you're paying the company to borrow their car for a number of years, with limitations, and then you're paying the company to take the used car off their hands. But that's true for all car companies, not just Tesla.

You can easily get a brand new one for not much more than that, with the possibility of a lower interest rate, and all the neat things like AP 2.5/3, faster screens, sentry and better batteries. Certain new ones even come with unlimited super charging, as you had with your original.

You may be able to negotiate a lower buy out, since it's not a new purchase but an end of term, and they'd otherwise have a old car they'd have to find a buyer for, but I've heard doing so is difficult with Tesla. Worth a shot, especially if you can find similar vehicles for sale for less on the Tesla website.

Het verschil in verlies tussen 2,5-4-6mm2 is bij 16 ampere niet echt schokkend:
Pv=I^2((l x rho)/a) = 16x16x((25 x 0,0175) / 2,5) = 44,8W x 3 = 134,4W
Pv=I^2((l x rho)/a) = 16x16x((25 x 0,0175) / 4) = 28W x 3 = 84W
Pv=I^2((l x rho)/a) = 16x16x((25 x 0,0175) / 6) = 18,6W x 3 = 55,8W

Mijn laadtijd is hooguit 6 uur dus ik verlies op 25m kabel 2.5mm2 6*134,4=806,4Wh = 17 eurocent
Met 6mm2 kabel is het verlies 6 * 55,8W = 334,8Wh = 7 eurocent

Spanningsval kan een reden zijn om dikker te gaan, maar de val over 25m is
Uv=I x ((l x rho) / a) = 16 x ((25 x 0,0175) / 2,5) = 2,8V x 2 = 5,6V in het slechtste geval, en
Uv=I x ((l x rho) / a) = 16 x ((25 x 0,0175) / 6) = 1,2V x 2 = 2,4V in het beste geval
Beide ruimschoots binnen de +/-10% marge die de netspanning mag hebben...

Aangezien die 25m kabel niet op een bosje ligt maar in de vrije lucht hangt of is ingegraven is koeling ook niet echt een issue, de kabel zal niet warm worden bij een verlies van 134W over 25m kabel...

De argumenten om 4mm te doen is als je 3 fase meer dan 11kW wil gaan laden, of als je 1 fase meer dan 3,6kW wil gaan laden, of als je kabellengte's hebt die ruim boven de 25m uitkomen. Of als je paranoia bent natuurlijk

like i said, i'll do a full write-up with pictures over the next week or so...but right now i had to put the car back together and tuck the fm direct adapter away because the cable on it just isn't long enough. i have it tucked into the passenger C-pillar right now until the 2.5mm extension cable i ordered from amazon comes in on wednesday.

a while back, someone opined that the connector on both the antenna amplifier and the radio unit itself (not the one that comes directly off the glass, the other one) looked like a FAKRA connector. i spent a while doing research and eventually found that it seems to be a FAKRA-B (white) connection, as the different FAKRA types are both color coded and lettered. the kicker, though, is that there's a light blue FAKRA-Z connector which is universal and fits all of the other FAKRA connectors.

the other day, i finally found these on amazon:

https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PJX5611

https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PHW5J6C

these are your antenna adapters that fit the connections in the model 3 perfectly and will allow you to connect the FM direct adapter. the catch is that it will only cut the signal completely if you disconnect the other connection to the actual radio unit (the ribbon cable and black connector)...i don't know how those two work together, so i'm not sure if there is anything hurt by disconnecting this. i can say though that even with the FM direct adapter in-line using those two adapters above, and the black connector disconnected, it seems to work just the same as it always has when the XM unit is turned off (which is what is supposed to happen with the FM direct adapter in the first place). i'm still able to use the FM radio if i turn the XM unit off, just as intended. to be honest, it does work if you leave the ribbon cable connected...just not as well. there were certain strong stations that the XM unit would not override with the ribbon cable connected, but once i disconnected that it was able to override everything (even the strongest stations).

i haven't noticed anything different, but i haven't really tested it fully yet other than a real quick drive around the neighborhood...i guess it's possible though that there might be a loss of range or something similar by disconnecting that ribbon cable. i won't be able to fully test it until the 2.5mm extension cable comes in, because like i said the one that is attached to the FM direct adapter isn't nearly long enough. for testing i had it stretched across the middle of the car and that wasn't even long enough to reach where i have the onyx plus mounted...i had to pull it out and put it in the cup holder.

If you shopped used, there should be no 2016 Model S of any kind in the 90k range 
59k isnt terrible, but you could find a better deal plus another a couple grand with negotiation. 
The only advantage I see here with purchasing your old car is if you value keeping same car and not having to go through car search, negotiation, potential shipment, etc.",,0,0,0,0

Understandable, and that's a great private party offer. Get connected with a good owner advisor at your local showroom and look out for inventory deals. Next month there will be absolute steals. For reference I found a demo P100D w/ ludicrous, 6 seat interior, black / white interior, and FSD for $99,100. The killer part was they discounted it $20k to $79,100 and had ludicrous for free for past owners.

Only advice is do not buy a 75 D. It's range is not enough for a family car, it's the biggest regret I've had with a Tesla and it collects dust on trips while we take the 3.

New email from Elon, via electrek.

Tesla needs to catch up on deliveries for record quarter, focus on cost, says Elon Musk in leaked email - Electrek

“While our demand is strong, we have a lot of vehicle deliveries to catch up to in order to have a successful quarter.”

“We also need to address the total cost of getting a car from our factory to the customer. Last quarter, there were many expedites fees and routing inefficiencies that led to higher than expected delivery costs. This makes it much harder for to* break even.”


“Per my earlier email, if we execute well, Q2 will be an all-time record for Tesla vehicle deliveries and an awesome victory!!”

This is the same c-rate as the LR cars experience at 150 kW, assuming 37 cells per brick in the MR battery and 46 in the LR.

Anyone on 19.15.11 might see higher than 121kW though as it appears to include a test profile for V3 Superchargers. It might go up to 150kW in the MR.

They're unwilling to negotiate... I tried. Those of you who said I could get a brand new one for not much more... I'm not sure what I'm missing because the lowest I seem to get to $91K-ish (after adding the rear seats, which cost $4K and are a must have for me).
""

Well, that's unfortunate they're not willing to negotiate. 

Are you talking about the trunk pop up seats? I didn't think they even made those anymore. I thought they died off back in the 2014-ish range. If you need the added seating, maybe a Model X would be better suited. 

But for the prices, we're speaking of existing inventory, or the most basic one. I priced out a Model S 75D, and the basic edition is 75k without the tax incentives or the state taxes/delivery fee, etc. For existing inventory, there's an 100D 2019 with unlimited for 81k (Los Angeles, CA). For the used section, there's a 2016 S70 for 43k (San Fransisco). That's just off the Tesla website, there is other services that have different price ranges.

I know you paid more than the 15k-25k difference your 2016 when new (compared to the 75k above) cost over the last three years to what they're pricing you now, but hey. It's a lease. They're meant for ease, not savings.",,0,0,0,0

My experience has been that the people in the stores are quite helpful but the delivery advisors are less than useful to be polite.

We've covered this before. The relative motion of a moving user terminal on a ground vehicle should be a non issue, especially since they intend to offer it for use on boats and airplanes. The real issue is that there's nowhere nice to put it since it's big and metal would interfere, you'd have to either come up with a way to transparently integrate it into a sunroof or to integrate it into a non-metal body panel (i.e., a plastic/carbon fiber/fiberglass hood or trunk lid), which is doable but not cheap.

We'll probably not see starlink terminals on regular cars (busses, RVs and Semis could be reasonable) for the foreseeable future both due to complexity of integration and if nothing else, the utility in dense cities is limited due to line of sight required to operate - it's utility would be mostly in rural applications, where cell coverage may not be so great. And it's probably easier and cheaper in the long run to just dot the countryside with solar powered, Starlink backhauled cell towers than to equip all vehicles with starlink.
""

I don't think they intend to offer it on boats, I think ships yes. Big difference between a ship that crests a medium wave once a minute vs a small boat that bounces on small waves non stop.

and as to planes they did the test on a very large military plane, not a tiny personal aircraft.



will perform a series of tests with the integrated airborne prototype terminal … varying motion for representative roll and pitch rates of a high-performance aircraft
""

note they didn't say anything about turbulence or vibration testing.

Scale matters, even if the craft is big enough to easily hold the antenna that doesn't mean it's stable enough to keep uninteruppted tracking while it's moving.

If you think there is no condition that would cause loss of signal due to craft movement, I disagree. I say a car/truck/RV on a bumpy road is worse than a ship or plane.

Is the cooling in the 3 pack really better than the cooling in the 100kWh S&X pack?

Track mode is mainly made possible by the non-induction rear motor and the Tesla designed and programmed VDC. Neither of which exist in the Model S or X. (Though they may be moving toward the Tesla VDC with the new adaptive suspension.)

Exactly! I know some say it's common to cross a double yellow line to pass a bike and hope/expect the oncoming traffic will move over...but if you can't pass the bike in time, you should wait behind the bike and allow oncoming traffic to use their lane! Just two days ago, I almost got hit by a car in my lane that was trying to pass a bike. Just because a driver is impatient about being behind a bike doesn't give them the right to cross the lines into oncoming traffic, endangering everyone in both lanes. It may be ""common courtesy"" but it's also against the law.

Now take that example of you almost getting hit two days ago, and imagine your car veering TOWARDS the oncoming car. Well thats exactly what has been happening to me.

The low voltage is always given as a range of 208-230. If the feed is 208 then the panel would normally have a neutral because it is a 208/120 panel that could be used for 120v to neutral single phase circuits. If it is a 230v panel then there would not be a neutral and it would be intended for primarily motor loads were single-phase (2-pole, not line to neutral ) or 3-phase 230v line to line voltage is needed.",,0,0,0,0

3702536,Heat batteri while braking?,AlanSubie4Life,2019-05-29 13:13:00,"I think the answer to the original question is that this heating of the battery is already being done when you have limited regen...how aggressively I am not sure (unless you are routing to a nearby Supercharger), but I'm not 100% sure it is being done in the case of a completely frozen battery. 

A few questions about this. Let's put aside the possibility of new hardware and just talk about what the car is currently capable of. 

Right now, as I understand it, the car has:
1) A way to run the motor (the rear since it can be done on the RWD vehicle) inefficiently to produce heat and heat the battery via the coolant loop. I've heard this is 2kW heat output capability but not sure whether it has been increased. The energy to produce this heating can come from the battery (it will work when going uphill, so runs in such a way as to produce torque but produce it less efficiently than normal). More questions about other energy sources below. 
2) A Cabin PTC heater, ~7kW, which runs directly off the (HV?) battery (I assume it runs off of the HV, and not the 12V DC/DC.)
3) Regen capability, which is easily capable of producing 60kW of power by producing a charging voltage (~400V or whatever voltage is produced for the particular SoC when pushing the available current into the battery) for the battery, but it must be limited if the battery is frozen (to prevent damage). 7-9kW is not going to produce a lot of slowing: At 25mph, 7kW will produce:
g's = 7kW/(25mph)/4200lbs/(9.81m/s^2) = 0.033g (Compare to emergency braking g's with MXM4s of ~0.95g, ~30 times as much)

Is all of the above correct?

Assuming it is, I have a few questions, in the condition of a 100% frozen cold-soaked battery, which is absolutely not able to accept any charge:

1) With this 100% frozen battery, for the battery heating produced by the motor, does the car have the capability of using regen to produce battery heating? Or must it extract that energy from the battery only via sending current to the motor? I can't think of a way to empirically determine this. We know there is a way for the car to limit the amount of regen power in cool conditions. But can it produce these low levels of ""regen"" (it wouldn't really be regen in this case because ZERO current can go to the battery since it is frozen) AND operate the motor in this inefficient warming regime? In other words, is there a way for the car to produce low levels of torque resisting rolling and put the resulting energy on the HV bus, but precisely in such a way as to ensure zero current to the battery (and of course zero current from the battery), run all the accessories, produce heat in the motor for warming the battery, etc. Or in this condition does Tesla just simply prevent any regen, and actually send power from the battery to the freewheeling motor in a way to produce zero torque but produce battery heat? 

2) Does turning on and off the CABIN heater in this condition affect the amount of regen available on a hill? To some extent this might answer part of question 1...in this ""zero-battery-charging-allowed"" frozen state, is it possible to extract energy from the hill (via the motor AC-DC converter), at all? Does anyone know? The empirical test would be (with a very cold cabin as well) to turn on and off cabin heat with a completely frozen battery, and see whether the amount of ""motor braking"" you get changes. It would need to be relatively flat to be perceivable, because the g forces would be quite limited as mentioned above. It might be possible to see the effect on the power bar/regen bar as well, if the surface were perfectly flat and you were moving at a constant speed, as you toggle heat on/off. 

If these questions could be answered we'd have a good idea whether Tesla was optimizing the efficiency of the heating systems with current hardware. I would think they are, though maybe they are gradually tweaking/improving as time goes on, too.",,0,0,0,0

Is the cooling in the 3 pack really better than the cooling in the 100kWh S&X pack?

Track mode is mainly made possible by the non-induction rear motor and the Tesla designed and programmed VDC. Neither of which exist in the Model S or X. (Though they may be moving toward the Tesla VDC with the new adaptive suspension.)

The main problem with high-speed/track use in the S&X is the large induction rear motor. It overheats very quickly, and the heat is next to impossible to remove from the rotor. It isn't the battery pack.

3702548,"""Automatic City Driving"" will be the first real FSD test",Daniel in SD,2019-05-29 13:18:00,"diplomat33 said:
↑

My thesis is that the ""automatic city driving"" feature when it is released will be the first real test of Tesla's FSD and whether they are on the right path or not.

I say this for a few reasons:
1) The current AP2 software is not ""feature complete"". it lacks important features. It is also not using the full NN that Tesla has developed for AP3. So it is very hard to use AP2 as a measure for Tesla's FSD.

2) Tesla has developed NN for AP3 that they claim will make FSD possible. So we should judge FSD by the software that Tesla itself is using to do FSD. Let's see if the new AP3 software really does have better vision, handles situations like stopped vehicles etc... ""Automatic City Driving"" will use this new software so we will see how it does.

3) City driving and intersections are a huge part of self-driving. And ""automatic city driving"" will make FSD ""feature complete"" according to Tesla. So the feature will give us an important look at what the total FSD package will look like. I am not saying that Automatic City Driving will be perfect out of the gate. I am merely saying it will be a true test of FSD. If we see that it handles intersections well, can react to other cars and objects better, can reliably react to stopped vehicles. handles steering better, etc, it will show us that Tesla is probably on the right path. Of course, if we see that the AP3 NN still can't detect stopped vehicles reliably for example, then we will get a clue that Tesla's FSD hardware and software may be seriously lacking. So I think once we get the new NN running on AP3 via the ""automatic city driving"" feature, we will get a better idea of whether FSD is doable or not.

Of course, it is possible that we might get a clue about FSD before ""automatic city driving"" is released if Tesla starts uploading the new NN to AP3 cars before releasing Automatic City Driving.

3702551,Can the Supercharger Network be profitable?,cpa,2019-05-29 13:19:00,"For the foreseeable future, Tesla will always have some sort of teaser in their sales models to provide for some complimentary Supercharging, even as the old Model S and X are retired from service that had free, unlimited. I presume the new Roadster with its hefty sales price will have free, unlimited Supercharging as part of the package.

In addition, there are a number of locations across the country where the landowner or chief tenant pays the electricity, and we are not charged. Yet Tesla likely still has to maintain these units.

Increased usage increases costs like preventative maintenance, repairs, replacements, and such. I do not see Tesla earning a profit from their Supercharger network. I think the best they can hope for is to cover their variable period costs, with depreciation, property taxes, and interest hitting the bottom line.

If--and this is a big if--Tesla can persuade competitors to use the Tesla standard for L3 charging, they might be able to earn enough income through licensing or other arrangements to bring their revenue up closer to break even.

I don't think there are any shading issues with the SolarEdge optimizers (which I believe is basically a DC-DC converter). You trade-off the failure mode of the sum of the string inverter plus the optimizer instead of a single failure of the microinverter (since the reliability of the passive combiners is very high, only really mechanical failure modes, no electrical failure mode). You would think there would be an efficiency loss but SolarEdge is actually better.

What do you make of the ""break even"" part of the email?
""

Tesla is attempting to get to full-cycle profit, i.e. breaking even for the year on GAAP accounting. Every excess cost makes it harder to do that. If the delivery logistics remain bad, with excessive costs due to poor routing, the need to pay for expedited shipping due to bad planning, etc., then this makes it harder to break even.

They need some sort of centralized master database which has (a) all orders, with their configurations, (b) the home/delivery location of each order, (c) the location of all possible delivery centers and storage lots, (d) the location of every car with its specific configuration, and (e) all the different methods of moving cars from one place to another, with how fast they are. Then they can try out different schemes for logistics in each area. I suspect from communications I've had with Tesla that they don't have the proper Information Technology support to really optimize this, though if we're lucky they're building that support.

Two of the weakest link of P3 are the brakes and suspension. Tesla walked a fine line between performance and comfort, for most of the customers, it might be perfect. However, I like my brake a lot more aggressive and suspension a lot more controlled and tight. When Mountain Pass Performance @MountainPass announced the Sports Coilovers for AWD/Performance Model 3 I jumped. I was number 11 on the queue. After seven months of the wait, the coilovers arrived. It was worth it, IMHO.

My P3 is a daily driver with the intention to do 3 to 6 track days. For daily driving, I have the rebound set at 10 and compression 12 per MPP recommendation. With this setting, it retains the comfort similar to stock, but with much better control in reduction of pitch during braking and acceleration, and great amount of reduction in body lean during cornering. The car feels planted over undulating bumps compares to wallowing of the stock suspension. There is no additional detectable noise or vibration to the MPP system.

I had upgraded my brakes to Racing Brake 380mm BBK before the MPP coilovers upgrade. During the bedding process of the new RB XT910 pads on the BBK, with the consecutive braking, I felt nauseous from the hard pitch of car. During the MPP installation, I swapped in RB XT970, which is more aggressive than the XT910. After the MPP installation, I ran the bedding process for the XT970. Even with the more aggressive pad, the pitch of car was significantly less, I was not nauseous at all. Here is the thread on the Racing Brake BBK installation and impression.

Now the installation instruction. MPP instruction is good, it covers all the basic, so my instructions will serve as a pictorial with insights to tricks I used to make this one-person installation as smooth as possible.

Prep:
1. Get a thin-wall 13mm socket, the OD should not be more than 16.75mm. This is necessary to remove the three nut that secures the damper to the suspension tower.
2. Old fashion hand file works the best to remove excess welding bead at the bottom and the side of the aligning pin. This is not a weight-bearing feature so removal of the weld bead at the bottom and side is okay.
3. I also used a Dremel tool to remove a bit of material around the alignment slot, in particular at the bottom portion.

View attachment 411832


Removal of the rear is pretty simple, use a jack to press up the low arm to reduce binding when removing the bolt holding the damper to the lower arm.

Remove the front upper arm pinch joint before removal of front damper. As you need to apply upward pressue to release the tension on the bolt.

Dissambling of stock damper/spring is the most challenge part of this installation. I used two sets of compression tools, one as safety, one does the actual work.

View attachment 411839


That is almost 50% compression, lots of potential energy stored in that spring.

This is how the front MPP should look. The helper spring is at the bottom. The seperation ring between the main spring and helper spring is packaged with the rear component, this caused some confusion.

View attachment 411843


For the rear, I found it was easier to install the spring first then install the adjuster on top of the spring.

I made these 3d printer cube for setting the preload on the spring. MPP recommended 28mm front, 15mm rear. Looking at multiple MPP photos of their car, it was way too low for me. My settings are 38mm front and 30mm rear. The cube allow for quick measurement/setting of height in 5mm increments.
""

That's a super helpful write up. One question - with those settings of 38 mm front and 30 mm rear how much lower would you estimate the car sits relative to its stock ride height? I've got the same kit coming sometime soon. I definitely don't want the car to look slammed and have it frequently bottoming out on driveways Etc. Great to hear that you can get maybe equal or even slightly better than stock comfort with significantly better than stock handling and dynamic control / composure. Also it looks like the central front control arm has some abrasion on it? Is that from rubbing on the track with your 9.5 by 19 inch wheel and re71 setup? Looks like it could be the inside of the tire but I can't tell.

Yes, all quarterly. Last 5 quarters R&D + SG&A has been around $1B/quarter. Probably longer - I've not checked.

Shouldn't most of the increase in service go to Service Cost ?
""

No. Tesla is opening additional service centers to have geographic coverage. This is fixed cost overhead -- leasing land (or paying property taxes), paying utilities.

The added centers will actually CUT service costs (of the sort allocated to service / warranty on the balance sheet). People like me in areas remote from service centers, who have prepaid mobile service or whose cars have actually broken, have been driving service costs up substantially due to the extensive expense of transporting the cars back and forth. In order to retain *any* goodwill, Tesla has had to cover a lot of these costs even when they haven't officially promised to, because nobody wants to face a $2000 bill to get their car to and from the service center. With service centers a reasonable distance away, people will drive or use their own towing services and Tesla won't have to deal with hotel stays, flights, etc.



That is definitely one item that has been increasing and I think will continue to increase. I don't know how they treat rent/lease on facilities for service center - whether that goes to SG&A or Service Cost or if its shared some kind of allocation.
""

The ""keeping the lights on"" overhead should be SG&A if they're doing the accounting right. I have no idea whether they're doing the accounting right; GAAP has prescribed incorrect accounting in the past.



R&D - Most of that cost is probably people. I expect Tesla to continue to hire more engineers for FSD and software - even as may be few are let go on the manufacturing side. Even so, generally Tesla wouldn't let a lot of manufacturing R&D engineers to go - may be only the ones they don't like - because it would be difficult to hire back good talent. They will probably get a few relaxed months after years of continuous hard work.
""

While I don't expect Tesla to lay off that many R&D people, I don't think they need to hire more people for hardware R&D. For Autopilot, there's a ""too many cooks"" problem; I doubt they could get much benefit by spending more than, say, $20 million a year extra. For the rest of their software they definitely need more people but again I don't think it would amount to more than $40 million a year to get it right-sized, probably less. Meanwhile, the costs of experimental tooling and prototypes (which are totally R&D) should be dropping.

By contrast, they could easily raise their overhead by $500 million/year by opening a suitable number of service centers. At that point I'd guess they'd be built out.",,0,0,0,0

So with around 7600 miles on the clock on my P3D+, the rear drive unit has failed.

Worth noting that I took delivery during 3rd quarter in 2018 (THE quarter when Tesla was pushing HARD to crank these out), AND I have self-installed an aftermarket sub/amp system. For what its worth, I've installed audio systems in my own cars for the last 8 cars and while that doesn't make me a pro, I also like to think I did it right/clean.

The short: rear drive unit failed, they're replacing the entire unit, i feel l

Full story:
My wife charged up to 100% on this trip as she was going far. When the battery was at around 56%, she felt what she described as the rear ""dragging"". During this time a message pops up saying ""Rear drive unit problem, car coming to a complete stop"" or something along those lines (i wasn't there). The car eventually comes to a complete stop in the middle of the road at 9pm. The message to try exiting and re-entering comes up (and doesn't work). Car won't shift into D or R. Wife calls Tesla support to explain the situation, and was told to call 911 (really?). I call Tesla myself to explain the situation, and they say they won't have a tow truck for the next 4-5 hours. While I'm trying to work out a tow with Tesla, I get a call from the wife because the police showed up and want to push the car off the road. I hang up with Tesla and walk through the steps with the wife to get it into transport mode. The car had trouble staying in transport mode, moving about a foot before the car shuts down (black screen, rear motors lock up). It took several reboots and putting into transport mode before they're able to get the car off the road. I couldn't have my wife sitting 150+ miles away by herself in the night for 4-5 hours, so I decided we'd use our our tow services with AAA to get the car to her friends house 40 miles away. The next morning, Tesla towed the car to the nearest SC. To which I got a loaner and was explained that the rear drive unit failed, it's rare, it's a big job, they'll need the car for a while as they want to monitor it after replacement, and that they'd let me know when its ready. This happened thursday night, today is Tuesday. Still waiting. They did not mention anything about the aftermarket sub or whether or not it had anything to do with the failure.

Does this change my love for the car? NO! I love it.

BUt it does leave me wanting more out of Tesla's support. I don't think tesla's response of calling 911 was appropriate. I also feel like the claims about having redundancy with having a dual motor car didn't work out here. And the fact that it kept coming OUT of transport mode can be frustrating/dangerous.

Anyways, just wanted to share as my googling of this issue has me concluded that while it has happened, it's not a super common thing.

That may be pure speculation. Tesla mentioned that they likely won't have a major update to hardware in two years, and I suspect they will try to push out the HW3 upgrade well before that time.

It got me thinking, Tesla just needs to perform, return to profitablity, and the stock should go back up, making this guy eat his words.

My question: If I remember right, Q1 was a $700M loss, but they also paid back a $900M+ loan, correct?
So did Tesla report a straight ""Gain from Operations"" number?

I do the accounting for my wife's small business, and this is what I do.
I report the gain each month from operations, separate from extraordinary items such as loan payments, etc.
This way the owners can tell if the company is generating money.

If you are asking for ""hey I want maps now"" and that's not what's in your car, they would have to replace the MCU with one that has it. And they're going to full bill for that new MCU because it's not a warranty swap. It's at your request.
They will move over whatever mobile card you have, so if it's 3G you'll end up with 3G.
""

Not always true. In my case, when my original 3G, 2014 MCU without tech package (no GPS nav) had a failing GPS module, they replaced the MCU with one with maps and LTE under warranty, no charge. I didn't ask for any upgrades. Maybe I just got really lucky. Or maybe they've run out of old hardware so the newer MCUs are all they can put in.

They later offered to add GPS nav for $145 so I did that. This may have been a discounted price because I took the car in 4 times trying to get them to fix the same problem with random ""Touchscreen unresponsive"" and all superchargers showing up as 50% opacity, meaning they were out of range. They kept diagnosing both as a touchscreen hardware problem and my touchscreen was actually replaced about four times (*facepalm*). Now they think Touchscreen unresponsive is a firmware problem (yet to be fixed) and the 50% opacity superchargers was a feature removed by an OTA firmware update for cars without GPS nav. Adding GPS nav fixed it so superchargers in range show up as 100% opacity again.",,0,0,0,0

No, it's not. Seat heaters (and even the car heating) are much lower amounts of current, by an order of magnitude than what is required to physically brake a car. You're talking about switching the regen typically going to a pack for battery to resistive coils, which means power on the order of 50-100kW. Assuming you could equally distribute it properly, you then need to be able to modulate and switch it. It's a pretty big redesign of the existing inverter, since now you have two paths that have to be switched independently (and probably need to operate simultaneously for most efficiency).

I'm not saying it isn't possible, I'm sure Tesla has actually investigated this to some extent already. I'm just saying that it's a pretty big redesign and cost adder. A lot simpler than just adding a heating coil to car seats or something.

Turns out gliding over the shoulder line a tad is a pretty normal way of driving on New England country roads. ELDA reeks of being tested mostly on highways, or clear straight roads.

Sorry if I missed it, but did you put in a complaint/suggestion directly to Tesla?
IMO they're should be an option to permanently turn off the feature.



It seems clear that there's magnitudes more discontent over this feature than is typical for updates. This is something Tesla should take very seriously. It's turned me from an enthusiastic promoter to no longer able to recommend the car to friends/family. I hope we get a fix soon, in which case I'll turn back into an enthusiastic promoter.

If 230v is not a thing here in the US then someone needs to inform NFPA so they can update the NEC. 

230v three phase, (three wire, no neutral) is a thing and commonly used for motors. NEC Table 430.250 gives the full load current for standard motors. If you look at it you will see there are columns for both single and three phase 230v motors and there is no mention of a 240 nominal voltage. Most industrial motors I come across these days are set up for dual voltage. The high voltage on the name plate is 460 or 480 (one or the other). The low voltage is always given as a range of 208-230. If the feed is 208 then the panel would normally have a neutral because it is a 208/120 panel that could be used for 120v to neutral single phase circuits. If it is a 230v panel then there would not be a neutral and it would be intended for primarily motor loads were single-phase (2-pole, not line to neutral ) or 3-phase 230v line to line voltage is needed.
""

So on motors you use a 230v motor on a 240v system. The logic is that 240v is nominally what would be delivered by the provider, but they figure some loss from the main delivery point to be motor, so they plan for a slightly lower voltage as the target voltage for the motor (but they can operate in a pretty wide range).",,0,0,0,0

I ordered 4/27 and as of today still have the Edit Design link available on the right side of the overview page (the page that loads after clicking on Manage).

That updated the price without changing my RN or order date so I assume I didn't ""lose my place"" in the VIN-assignment waiting list. That seems to be the easiest way to do it assuming the edit link is still available.

I noticed that the price breakdown in the payment section didn't automatically update immediately after submitting the edit (the car price was updated but the tax and total section were still showing the old numbers). I logged out and gave it a few minutes, received the confirmation email from Tesla that my order was modified, logged back in and the amounts are all correct now.

Just had some relatives over for lunch and wanted to relay a story. We were discussing EV's and Tesla and my cousin said: ""I heard they are going bankrupt"". He also went on to say they would never have a car near $35k so I took him to the website and we pretended to order a Model 3. We had the entire family gathered around my laptop where I preceded to pull up the standard range Model 3 with no options (Black, stock wheels, black interior and no autopilot) ... total was $39,900 and I told them they could still get $3750 in tax credits. Brings us to $36,150 .... which seemed to shock them. Not sure if they get any additional incentives from their state (TX) but even without any additional incentives they were pleasantly surprised. The next thing he said was: "" yeah but when will I get the car? I heard they were really backed up"" .... I told him it wouldn't be out of the question to get it in a few weeks. I'm not exactly sure but I'm under the impression that what I told him was accurate. Of course there was also the question about range and where to charge ....

All of which tells me that once again Tesla has to do a better job of educating the average consumer ... I know Elon's not a fan of advertising but I think Tesla needs to give it serious consideration ... just to educate the public.

Cheers to the longs ...
""

That’s an accurate reaction from people in TX. Plus you can get the $35,000 option by calling it in. 
But I agree a small amount of education will go a long way. However, the consumer will ultimately be the salesman. That’s why I believe demand is only going to pick up from here. I’ve probably had over a dozen interactions with people about my car since I got it and it’s easy to have all the answers for them.

Hi! First time poster here.

I have a 2016 Model S 70D with 21K miles and rear seats added on.

I've considered buying a newer Model S (I didn't like the Model 3), but I actually really like my current car and feel no overwhelming desire for a new one.

US Bank has quoted the buyout at $59K. I was about to buy it, but wanted to make sure it's not a total rip-off.

What do you guys think?

↑

Don't follow your thinking about the S/X line sharing ""makes sense"".
""

You're a newbie here. The S & X have been sharing general assembly for years. When the X body line was designed, it was DESIGNED and INTENDED to produce S and X simultaneously, but for unknown reasons, they never started building S on it, continuing to use the original (extremely inefficient) S body line.

They're just completing the original plan. I don't know what the original bottleneck was which prevented them from making S bodies on the same line as the X, but it might simply have been total capacity on the body line. With slighly lower Model S demand (now that Model 3 is out), and various improvements to the model X body line, they may simply feel that they're ready to do the conversion now.



The S and X may have a few parts in common, but the assembly is not so much alike.
""

The body assembly is EXTREMELY similar. Yeah, the doors attach funny on the Model X, but the rest is basically the same series of welding steps. I mean, not literally the same, but the parts are basically put in the same relation to each other and welded by the same sort of robots; you just have to program the robots differently. They can totally intermix S and X on the same body line and it was designed to do so.

General assembly has more parts which differ from S to X but that's *already* handling S and X intermixed on the same line.

Steps before the body line are done somewhere else. Though at this point I suspect S and X powertrains of being made on the same line, after the Raven revision.
-----

FWIW, removing the original ""Line 1"" Model S body line frees up a truly massive amount of factory space. The X line takes up half as much space. The lines for model 3 each take up about as much space as the X line. In addition, the S line has a screwy layout which crosses ""general traffic"" lanes repeatedly.

There was also a lot of warehousing inside the main factory building. After they built the two extremely tall ""pick a part"" warehouse extensions, they should hopefully have been able to clear out a lot of that. They're still going to use the parking lot to expand to build the Model Y line though.",,0,0,0,0

He said “that’s normal”

I said... I’ve never seen that in my 20 years of getting previous cars tinted... to which he said “sigh.. I’ll take care if it for you “ with a half smile and half annoyance.

I said, do you expect me to just leave it alone? To which he replied with a smug, “I’ll take care of it for you” with a more serious tone this time 

I kind of stood there, speechless. 

I was expecting an apology for having to drive back to the shop, take half day off from work just to bring the car back because of THEIR mistake, especially after paying $500 for a tint job.

But no, he just gave me this annoying stare and said “it will be taken care of ...” no apology, no other details , no hint of taking responsibility. He said it won’t take long.
I said how long, he said not long. I said I need to know approx time, he finally said 2-3 hours , lol. I said ok, I need to get back home.

I replied and told him I spent $25 on Uber when I brought the car to him the first time. Now, I have to spend an additional $25 on top of taking a day off work.

I said I think it’s fair you cover my Uber.

They kept diagnosing both as a touchscreen hardware problem and my touchscreen was actually replaced about four times (*facepalm*). Now they think Touchscreen unresponsive is a firmware problem (yet to be fixed) and the 50% opacity superchargers was a feature removed by an OTA firmware update for cars without GPS nav. Adding GPS nav fixed it so superchargers in range show up as 100% opacity again.

Not sure if elda problems are real, or the people having issues are just bad drivers....

All these stories like “I was just crossing over the median like normal when elda came out of nowhere”.

If that’s not the case here, I’m sure it eventually will be as self driving becomes safer than humans but humans still think they are better 
""

The problems are very real, just not universal. I've had 10 or 11 false positives myself, all due to wacko Dutch country roads with bike lanes, and trees close to the road. No interventions whatsoever on highways or regular roads.

ELDA triggers, currently too quick, on crossing lines while driving in the direction of hard objects like trees, as it only intervenes when it sees immediate danger of collision due to the lane departure. This is a pretty specific situation that was likely not triggered in testing regions but turns out to be too frequent in The Real World.

Is it potentially dangerous? Certainly. Directly life threatening to Tesla drivers? No, not that bad. Does it need to be fixed? Most definitely. Was it already confirmed by Tesla engineers that they're working like mad to fix some issues with 16.2? Yep, on Reddit. Can it take some days? Yes, they likely want to be damn certain an update doesn't make it worse.

Lots of talk about Emergency Lane Departure Avoidance.



From Tesla's Blog....
Emergency Lane Departure Avoidance
Emergency Lane Departure Avoidance is designed to steer a Tesla vehicle back into the driving lane if our system detects that it is departing its lane and there could be a collision, or if the car is close to the edge of the road. This feature will automatically be enabled at the beginning of every drive, but can be turned off for a single drive by going to the Autopilot Controls menu.


At Tesla, improving safety is our primary goal, even after a customer purchases their car. That’s why we’re introducing these features beginning today via a free over-the-air software update, starting with Model 3 owners and gradually expanding to all cars that were built after October 2016. This is just another way that we are helping to protect Tesla drivers and passengers, and others on the road, every day

This also shows the cognitive dissonance.

But seriously - there are a lot of things the common folk *just don't know* about the current state of Tesla. Since people don't want Tesla to advertise, I'd say they need to *educate* people. They wouldn't have to do it if all the free press Tesla gets was factual - but alas it is mostly fabricated.

Anyone why says Tesla shouldn't advertise - ask a few of your colleagues and find out how much they know about Tesla. Tesla really needs to do some web ads - just showing them availability and cost of 3.
""

They don’t. As long as they are selling all they are making they don’t need to advertise. The AP and car improvements as well a word of mouth are opening up new customers. Look at all the magazine that are finally reviewing the M3P and “discovering” it is better and cheaper than a BMW M3 or Audi or AR. The M3P has been out and available for almost a year! Track mode has been out for 6mo. What new sports car takes that long to get reviewed? Almost all the youtube comments I have read lately have gone Tesla positive and that is on “gas car” channels. The enthusiasts are switching that is all the advertising they need. I think shortly after Advanced Summon drops Tesla goes back to a month + waiting list to get a car.",,0,0,0,0

3702793,High-usage supercharger station,cpa,2019-05-29 14:19:00,"Tesla is using the one-size fits all mentality for this recurring problem. Someone really ought to parse all the data from all the Superchargers and determine how and when to apply this 80% limitation. Then make it so the charging bar cannot be increased to a level >80% at times.

It seems to me that frequency of usage boils down to geography and time of day. Superchargers in urban areas should be capped at the 80% limit for all comers except for the wee hours of the morning when it is odds-on that there is or will be no congestion. Those traveling (not living within) through these urban areas will have many opportunities to recharge elsewhere 60-100 miles away. It may be a bit of a hassle or an inconvenience for them, but we must think of the greater good afforded by this limitation. It only hurts for a little while!

Superchargers that are in remote areas generally should not have this restriction, or the slider should be enabled to charge >80% if it does appear. Bad weather, side trips, smaller batteries, towing, and other drains on the battery necessitate a higher charge at times. And there will be those isolated incidents when a number of stalls are down or during popular heavy travel times. Tesla has enough of these data to be able to program these limitations during the appropriate conditions.

It just seems to me from these anecdotes, that someone ginned up a facile software solution without drilling down into the detail and determining how distance and usage affects the ultimate charging levels that people feel they need to continue their journey. 

I can hear the catcalls and other complaints when inexperienced drivers stop the charge at 80% and continue on their trek only to see suddenly the nag on the screen to keep your speed below 65 (or 55) to reach your destination.

Finally, I offer a real-life example from smack-dab here in the Valley: Along SR99 between Sacramento and Bakersfield, Superchargers are at Manteca and Fresno. Manteca to Fresno is about 110 miles. No problem. To continue east from Bakersfield to Barstow (after charging in Fresno) and either Interstate 40 or Interstate 15 requires a stop in Mojave, about 180 miles from the Fresno Supercharger and 220 rated miles per EVTripplanner. If one were to rely upon the 80% rule, and if one were to utilize the in-car charging routine, one would be routed to Kettleman City or the Bakersfield - I5 Supercharger before being able to head east across Tehachapi Pass on SR58 to Mojave. Yet, a 90+% charge at Fresno will reach Mojave satisfactorily with about a 10% reserve in an 85. The additional driving, charging, and rerouting to Interstate 5 adds an hour or so, yet charging to 93% adds maybe 20 minutes of charging.",,0,0,0,0

Tesla is not an ordinary car company, they pride themselves on constantly upgrading existing cars to keep them fresh that’s what separates them from an legacy car manufacturer

As for depreciation I bought mine for $62K as well, received several private sale offers for $49K this week. So that would be around a $13K hit, but only $6.5K hit with the tax credit offset.

I am in the group that paid peak retail for no AP LR RWD too (In fact, we got two - his and hers.) I don't feel overlooked at all. Let's look at the facts:

When I ordered, EAP was a $5k option and FSD $3k for a total of $8k at purchase. The order page informed me that I would be able to get those options after purchase for $6k and $4k respectively for a total of $10k. I made the decision not to buy these options at purchase based on that information, thinking (mistakenly) that at anytime for the life of the car I could purchase at the $10k price.
Shortly after, the post-purchase price for AP/FSD went up, giving me a tinge of regret.
We then each had the 30 day trial with the option to purchase EAP for $5.5k, which we also declined.
I lost track of all of the variations in between, but as others have stated, we had the opportunity at one point to buy AP for $2k and FSD for $3k. This was $3k less than the at-purchase option and half the cost of the $10k I originally expected. (Still I didn't buy it - used the event to justify buying wider, lighter wheels, 200 treadwear tires and a BBK.) My wife did take advantage of the $2k AP on her car as she likes the TACC.
As of today, if I decided to add the option, I could get AP for $3k and FSD for $6k, which is still $1k less than what I was told it would cost to add it when I ordered.
Seems to me, I'm in a better position and Tesla has exceeded my expectations.

Oh, but I still have a complaint - Why can't an appropriate version of Track Mode be made available for non-P cars? I'd gladly pay up to have it as an option!

That's a super helpful write up. One question - with those settings of 38 mm front and 30 mm rear how much lower would you estimate the car sits relative to its stock ride height? I've got the same kit coming sometime soon. I definitely don't want the car to look slammed and have it frequently bottoming out on driveways Etc. Great to hear that you can get maybe equal or even slightly better than stock comfort with significantly better than stock handling and dynamic control / composure. Also it looks like the central front control arm has some abrasion on it? Is that from rubbing on the track with your 9.5 by 19 inch wheel and re71 setup pre or post rotor swap out? I assume that with the rotors and the thicker rotor hats you've Lost that hub mounting lip such that effectively your wheel offset has decreased by something like 4 to 5 mm. With 35 mm front offset and the revised rotor hat thickness you should have plenty of room in the front I would think so I'm assuming that this rubbing was before the rotor hat swap out? Looks like it could be the inside of the tire rubbing but I can't tell.

Thanks again for a very helpful and informative write-up!

Approximate 20mm drop from stock with 38mm front and 30mm rear preload spacing on coilover. 

The rub was documented by me on some other thread and resolved in February before the MPP install.

You're a newbie here. The S & X have been sharing general assembly for years. When the X body line was designed, it was DESIGNED and INTENDED to produce S and X simultaneously, but for unknown reasons, they never started building S on it, continuing to use the original (extremely inefficient) S body line.
""

Ok, I'll buy that. I am new compared to Tesla actually making model S and X cars. 




They're just completing the original plan. I don't know what the original bottleneck was which prevented them from making S bodies on the same line as the X, but it might simply have been total capacity on the body line. With slightly lower Model S demand (now that Model 3 is out), and various improvements to the model X body line, they may simply feel that they're ready to do the conversion now.
""

If it is true that they have been running two shifts on these two lines, then it will be hard to combine them into three shifts on one line. Maybe they are giving up some production capacity of the pricier cars in order to get the model Y production up on the capital they have. 




The body assembly is EXTREMELY similar. Yeah, the doors attach funny on the Model X, but the rest is basically the same series of welding steps. I mean, not literally the same, but the parts are basically put in the same relation to each other and welded by the same sort of robots; you just have to program the robots differently. They can totally intermix S and X on the same body line and it was designed to do so.
""

Are you saying they can intermix at the car level the production of the two cars? Each car on the line can be an S or an X without issues? I would expect issues with that. 




General assembly has more parts which differ from S to X but that's *already* handling S and X intermixed on the same line.

Copper resistivity: 1.68e-8 OhmMeter
Copper density: 8960 kg/m^3
AWG 10 wire
diameter: 2.588mm
cross area: 5.26mm^2
Onderdonk fusing current for copper wire AWG10 for 1s =1.6kA
P=100kW
U=400V
I=P/U=250A
R_wire = U/I = 1.6Ohm
Length of copper wire with 1.6Ohm impedance for AWG10 = 1.6 / ( 1.68e-8 * 1e6 / 5.26 )= 501m
Weight of 501m long AWG10 copper wire = 5.26e-6*501*8960 = 23.6kg
Price of copper: $3/lbs = $6.6/kg
Price of the copper for the cable above = $156

plus manufacturing and insulation costs


501m of wire can easily distributed evenly along the battery.
No need for modulation or major inverter modifications, just one more output. That's the beauty of a resistive heater.
""

You don't get what I said, do you? I have no doubt you can pick out an appropriate sized wire that won't fuse and can act like a car seat heater but for the entire battery... your idea of using copper wire strung through the battery is a pretty bad idea though. Just because it fuses at 1.6kA doesn't mean you want to actually use that to heat something up... dumping 100kW into the battery using 10ga wire is a horrible idea, because you can't pull the heat away fast enough for it to actually be useful... I don't think you want glowing copper wiring next to your battery. That stuff needs time to absorb and redistribute the heat, hence why coolant loops were discussed.

BUT, assuming you have a coil that works, in order to actually use braking force to be a resistive heater, you need to have a separate output that is modulated exactly the same way the regen charges the battery. No one wants to just suddenly add 100kW of 'drag' onto the motor to run the resistive heater. For best usage it should essentially be set so regen and resisitive heating are combined to the total (i.e. if it pulls 75kW in full regen, if it's at only 25kW regen cause of cold it would pull 50kW of resistive heating). That requires the inverter modifications that I mention.

If you set it up like a regular seat heater, then you now are wasting tons of power and your efficiency is in the gutter. There's no free lunch here.",,0,0,0,0

To: TomLee

Since we ordered on the same day, just wondering whether you received your ""welcome letter"" via email yet? Mine just came in today. See extract below:

Hi [PITA Customer],

Thank you for your order and welcome to the Tesla Family!

...

We will send you a reminder closer to your delivery date to confirm your Payment Details in full. Please confirm your Ownership Details in the interim, to avoid any delay with your order.​
From what I've read, it's just a form letter and we're supposed to ignore it, but I wonder if it's a sign the VIN countdown is on? I just hope I don't get blocked for a DOS attack on the Tesla website by checking so often!!
""

@9-Volt Sounds you are ahead of me on that! I have only received two emails so far from Tesla, one ""Thank you for your order"" letter with a MVPA (not much detail on $#) on the same date I ordered; the other one is ""Your Trade-In Offer is Ready"" letter on the second day. I have rushed in all the documents they required in the first two days but haven't received anything since. Did they include a revised MVPA, VIN or delivery date in the email?

Anyway, it's a good sign at lease we were not forgotten! Looking around this forum, Tesla is delivering the early May orders now. So I figure it's about time for us to receive a letter from Tesla with a guesstimated delivery date in these two days. Best scenario for us is mid-Jun delivery, but consider the early to mid May surge, end of June delivery is acceptable.

Let me know if there's any update on your side. I'll do the same thing too. Thanks!",,0,0,0,0

On my recent journey to Cincinnati and back to California, all stations were in good order heading east on 15, 40, 44, 64, and 71. Coming home was a different matter. Three stalls (at least) were broken at Beech Grove (south of Indianapolis). I was able to reach the agent using roadside support, yet the touchscreen showed no reduced service. And the internal software at Tesla confirmed my concern!

Similarly, two other locations in Wyoming had grit in the plugs and could not be plugged in snugly thereby activating the dread orange ring around the charge port. I was fortunate that no one else was present.

Both times I called the agent said he would notify ""the Supercharger Team."" This approach using an interlocutor is insufficient. With over 200,000 Teslas in the US alone now, there should be ways to notify Tesla timely and easily when stalls are not functioning. That information should be able to be sent immediately to our vehicles when we are within range of the Supercharger.

Similarly, we should be able to request alerts for Superchargers along our journey to notify us that at Location Z, stalls 2B, 4A and B are inoperable, or operable, but at substantially reduced power. It is easier to plan our charging when we have advance notice.

↑

I have no doubt you can pick out an appropriate sized wire that won't fuse and can act like a car seat heater but for the entire battery... your idea of using copper wire strung through the battery is a pretty bad idea though. Just because it fuses at 1.6kA doesn't mean you want to actually use that to heat something up... dumping 100kW into the battery using 10ga wire is a horrible idea, because you can't pull the heat away fast enough for it to actually be useful... I don't think you want glowing copper wiring next to your battery. That stuff needs time to absorb and redistribute the heat, hence why coolant loops were discussed.
""

I won't suggest using an cylindrical wire. Cross section would be most likely rectangular.

Heat capacity of copper: 38.5J/degC per 100g
1J = 0.000277778 Wh 
23.6kg / 100g * 38.5J / degC * 0.000277778 Wh/J = 2.524 Wh/degC
P=100kW
Temperature change of the copper wire in 1 second = 100kW / 2.524 Wh/degC /3600 = 11 deg C / second
In 5 seconds and braking by 100kW the wire's temperature changes by 55 deg C. Then this heat has couple of minutes to flow into the cells until the next braking.

This looks totally doable to me. However it adds weight and cost. These can be reduced by using different material. And most likely the electric heater is cheaper but slower.



Kirby64 said:
↑

BUT, assuming you have a coil that works, in order to actually use braking force to be a resistive heater, you need to have a separate output that is modulated exactly the same way the regen charges the battery. No one wants to just suddenly add 100kW of 'drag' onto the motor to run the resistive heater. For best usage it should essentially be set so regen and resisitive heating are combined to the total (i.e. if it pulls 75kW in full regen, if it's at only 25kW regen cause of cold it would pull 50kW of resistive heating). That requires the inverter modifications that I mention.
""

pretty simple modification



Kirby64 said:
↑

If you set it up like a regular seat heater, then you now are wasting tons of power and your efficiency is in the gutter. There's no free lunch here.
""

I'm braking and battery is cold so I can't store the energy elsewhere. Not sure what efficiency are you referring to? Anything that went into the wire is warming the battery. 
It adds weight though. Just by looking at the numbers, sizing the system to 50kW the weight could come down. Adding a heater like in Model S adds weight as well.",,0,0,0,0

Too specific details. But I am guessing model S is anyway not selling that much. To push the current S, Tesla can always throw in supercharging and FSD. Wouldn’t hurt margin much.

In 2017, I could not drop $130k for a P100DL and made the decision to buy vs lease a S75 because the lease rates pushed the monthly payments to $1000/mo.

Should I sell my 75 and buy the new inventory P100DL and chalk up the past two years as leasing an incredible car while waiting for my dream car? Some considerations (which is where I need your help):

I have free unlimited supercharging now and they are now offering that again on new inventory
$20k free ludicrous upgrade
Autopilot is now included in the base price and I don’t feel overly compelled to purchase FSD
New drive units, charging speed increase and HW3 is nice, but not as much of a game changer as going from a 75 to a P100DL to warrant the additional $20k+ of buying new over new inventory
Tax credit halves again in July from $3750 to $1875 (although there may be a bill passed to up it to $7k for another 400,000 vehicles if congress decided to do anything productive) - not sure its worth the wait or the risk of it not happening
Potential flood of new inventory cars to hit towards end of 2Q
Do we know if current new inventory Model S still comes with wireless connectivity for the life of the car (or until they decide to turn it off) vs the one year they offer on Model 3?
I see that they may refresh the Model S in September, but all signs point to moving more towards the Model 3 in terms of a minimalistic cabin which I don’t like (I like the two displays with one over the steering wheel)
Am I missing anything? I’d like to hear from the group and, of course, if anyone is interested in a silver S75, just let me know!",,0,0,0,0

Here's some real world testing from Electrek

https://electrek.co/2019/05/28/tesla-ev-efficiency-test-kona-ev-audi-e-tron/
""

The e-tron actually has a similar feature of the Autopilot, which is the Driver Assistance Package. Perhaps, the E-tron model you test drove was didn’t have the feature...? I’ve tested their so called Autopilot and it just doesn’t compare to how Tesla does it. It’s more like lane keeping assist with adaptive cruise control only. It felt weird coz it automatically disengages and re-engages. I didn’t feel comfortable using it and part of it is I’ve gotten so used to with Tesla’s AP and how clear it is when you’re on Autopilot. Needless to say that Tesla is superior!

To: Everybody

From: Elon Musk

Date: May 29, 2019

While our demand is strong, we have a lot of vehicle deliveries to catch up to in order to have a successful quarter.

Starting tomorrow, I will be holding skip-level calls with the America, Asia and Europe delivery teams every 2 days to understand what’s needed to accelerate our rate of deliveries.

We also need to address the total cost of getting a car from our factory to the customer. Last quarter, there were many expedite fees and routing inefficiencies that led to higher than expected delivery costs. This makes it much harder for Tesla to break even.

Per my earlier email, if we execute well, Q2 will be an all-time record for Tesla vehicle deliveries and an awesome victory!

Tesla trend or Tesla goal ??
continuous improvement 
Downward trends on costs are often a result of this pursuit.

Wall Street mentality wants Increased profits to go to stockholders - not reduced prices for customers.

EXPECT newer Tesla to be better and cheaper year after year after year.

Many just don't get it.
WHY would anyone in a capitalistic society want to improve a product IF they didn't need to?
WHY would any company in a capitalist country want to pass along savings vs increasing profits?
WHY do you think some people want to get rid of Elon as CEO? More profits for Wall St./stockholders - seriously? seems so

Improve design on each generation of product?
Wall St.: NO, don't waste money - increase profits.
Elon: Make compelling products and people will buy them. If you can't do that you deserve to go out of business.

Some suggest this is disruptive. You?
Some just call you a fanboy or part of the Tesla Cult (Lutz and Wall St. analyst love those terms)

I don't think this is feasable at all unless you are talking about small sailing vessles staying in costal waters. Don't underestimate the amount of power it costs to have Radar, fridge, freezer, computers, heating, washing machine, pumps, long range radios/phones for internet etc running (and warming water if you dont have a gas boiler). Yes you can connect an alternator to the propeller but that will generate only about 200 watts at decent sailing speed from my own experience (+some extra kw you get from solar and wind power). And in an emergency you need to have enough power to have bilge pumps constantly running. A good diesel engine is extremly reliable and there is a reason crusing yachts carry much more fuel than they really need.
""

Oil is pretty amazing stuff, hard to best it. A while back I ran the numbers on what it would take to do a solar/electric/wind container ship and was surprised that it's already pretty much feasible if there was not a battery shortage, but nobody had put them all together yet, kind of like Tesla ten-ish years ago. Same principles apply to big ships as cars, and like cars, it eventually just makes more sense in pretty much every way. Interesting thing is instead of charging, the cargo ships may end up going back to sails , and ironically there may come a point in 10? years when cargo ships still carry oil, but don't run on it.",,0,0,0,0

""

@ZachShahan
The thing about estimates and estimators is that they are mostly misses and sometimes hits. Many people including Meredith Whitney predicted housing crisis. They became rock stars. But since then their forecasts have been at best average. So never depend on one forecasters.

In banking sector, that is why the macro forecasters depend on consensus data, and similar is the case for the analyst consensus in cases of earnings. This is because most of the forecasts are going to be wrong, and hence it is safer to use an aggregate information so that your view is at least aligned with the markets aggregate decision. Again even consensus forecasts can be equally wrong. 

As for this specific case, Troy’s method is based on data but he is ignoring two points and I have asked him without getting good response. One the TMC tracker data is showing very strong demand vs Q1. Second, he continues to ignore Elon’s now two emails. Third, the number of ships leaving US to China and EU are more likely carrying full capacity vs. limited capacity in Q1. This last point was indirectly made by Zach in the Earnings Call. 

In the end, only time will tell and he may still be right. But it is better to depend on multiple source of data than one. Also if you hear from Elon as directly as he has said, the error margin should not be 19-20k. It most likely will be lesser.",,0,0,0,0

That first sentence stings! 

Whatever size of fleet “Shadow Mode” operates on (saw it suggested it required HW3, which would be internal only to Tesla until the last month or so), I think this brings up the fundamental limitation of the concept. Without expert, external guidance it is extremely difficult to accurate assess achievement of “safe driving” goals.

Chicken & Egg issue, in a sense, to automate the learning, because how does the system validate that the drivers it is watching are doing it correctly, or doing it the only correct way?

<edit> Put another way, how does the system discern a false positive when the very goal of the feature it is testing assumes the driver makes mistakes & feature is to correct the mistake.
""

This seems super easy to test. You run the system in shadow mode. You look at all the times the system wants to take evasive action. You look at how many times the lack of evasive action resulted in an accident. All the rest of the cases are false positives. Obviously some false positives are acceptable.
For all we know Tesla rolled out this update to early access participants and it reduced the accident rate.

I already bought 2018 100D with a price 93.5(white on white, 6 seat, EAP). But the front 2 seats has stretch marks and blue jean dye. I have the option of returning this car now. I already applied the window tint and I may loose the loan interest of around 1000 to 1200. I ordered the new standard range now with same config, but only AP for 91.5k. I work from home and may go once or twice for long trips. I get new seats with new AP hardware and new suspension, but less range 255 vs 295. Price is same for both now as I already lost 2.5k with the tint and loan interest. What do you do in this situation. Keep 100D or buy the new Standard range? Also, Is the standard range battery is same as the 100D and the difference is only the range or am I missing anything?

Thanks,",,0,0,0,0

The e-tron actually has a similar feature of the Autopilot, which is the Driver Assistance Package. Perhaps, the E-tron model you test drove was didn’t have the feature...? I’ve tested their so called Autopilot and it just doesn’t compare to how Tesla does it. It’s more like lane keeping assist with adaptive cruise control only. It felt weird coz it automatically disengages and re-engages. I didn’t feel comfortable using it and part of it is I’ve gotten so used to with Tesla’s AP and how clear it is when you’re on Autopilot. Needless to say that Tesla is superior!

There should be no need to have the Tesla App running at all. It is not a requirement when using the phone as a key. What Apps are running (if any) also is of no consequence. What is important is that bluetooth is enabled, and operational on your phone when you walk up to your car. Even if you do not force close the Tesla App on your phone, IOS will not allow it to continue running after a few minutes. If you swipe back into it, the phone will display an image of the App running while it relaunches - its a bit of visual trickery.

This has not been my experience. I agree with apps sleeping, but for me if i force close the app, when I come to my car, it simply will not unlock until I open the app. On the contrary, if I don’t force close it and go to the airport and don’t use the apps for days, when I get to my car, it unlocks without issue.

The deal we offer is not a discount on Opti-Coat coating, but a bundle special on tinting for the group members. Thank you. First lucky member is here!",,0,0,0,0

Unfortunately, for the same reason, that's a tiny slice of data that would take a lot of time to build up.



Tesla has 500k cars on the road and they’ve been rolling out this feature randomly so they’ll know very quickly or not whether it reduces the accident rate.

↑

It is widely reported that the Aero wheel hubcaps increase performance by about 4%.
""

Whatever the improvement, it is more useful to talk about the Wh/mi improvement provided by the aeros at a specific speed than a %. This improvement, specified in Wh/mi at a certain speed, should be roughly the same regardless of exact Model 3 vehicle.

The reason it matters is that the aero wheel covers:
1) Provide minimal benefit below 40-50mph. Because aero just is not that significant there.
2) A % does not take into account whether the vehicle is RWD or AWD. A RWD vehicle will see a greater % improvement in efficiency due to its overall better efficiency. This means the aeros will buy you a few more miles of range in a RWD than an AWD.
3) Related, in winter time, these things matter even less. If your baseline consumption is more like 300Wh/mi in mid-winter because you're trying to stay warm, or are plowing snow with your tires, or you have studded tires (or performance tires!), or it's raining with a blasting crosswind, the aeros start to matter a lot less.

Keeping the Wh/mi number in mind allows you to determine the efficiency improvement more easily for a given set of conditions.

Based on above posted non-scientific tests, it does seem most likely that the improvement is something less than 10Wh/mi @70mph, but that's not nothing. Might be 15 miles of range improvement for an LR RWD vehicle at that speed (but again, the gain in miles depends on the efficiency being achieved for that drive!).",,0,0,0,0

Sure EV's are digitally controlled and ICEV's are mostly analog controlled but the driver in both vehicles is an analog device.

Yea except I had already sold my car weeks ago and was borrowing a vehicle for like a month, and I had already rejected the first car, so was wondering if I would even get the tax credit before the end of the year.

So playing around with 2019.16.2 on my S100D AP2/MCU1:

- MCU1 performance seems improved. Even compared to turning traffic off, it seems like they did some tweaking beyond fixing that bug.
- the zoomed display is pretty cool but there is a usability caveat:
- the “spinning/dancing cars” issue feels more problematic with the zoomed in screen. Now when driving around at slow speeds there’s gigantic white blobs spinning around that are much more attention grabbing than parking sensor indications

3703192,Market politics,wdolson,2019-05-29 17:45:00,"None of the Democratic candidates really leap out at me as the person I really want to see as president. Ultimately we all need to be pragmatists. Psychologically a large swath of the American public is very traumatized right now. The capriciousness of the current president along with his constantly changing messaging is driving a lot of people nuts. My SO is both a lawyer and a Psychologist and she's seeing a lot of people showing signs of severe stress over the current political situation.

When people are stressed, they run to the known over the unknown. There are quite a number of Republicans who are traumatized by Trump who have expressed that Biden would be an acceptable choice for them. A lot of independents will probably be looking for a known quantity in 2020 too. If he could run again, I wouldn't be surprised if Barack Obama could win a third term quite easily.

Biden doesn't have the greatest track record, but he has expressed regret at many of the legislative blunders he's made. He also has demonstrated he changes with the times too. He's always been a tick left of center, wherever the ""center"" has wandered over the decades.

Trump is most nervous about Biden because Biden puts the biggest dent in the constituency he needs to win re-election. Biden appeals to the same rural, white Democrats that Bill Clinton appealed to. 

This is a very good article that shows the differences between the majority of Democrats and the most vociferous Democrats:
The Democratic Electorate on Twitter Is Not the Actual Democratic Electorate

Biden is ahead in the polls because the quiet majority of Democrats are seeking a known quantity rather than the bold new thing.

Presidential campaigns often listen to people who take the time to write in. I suggest a number of us write the Biden campaign and let them know who Jim Chanos really is and what he's been trying to do. You might see Biden distance himself from him.

If the trends in electing Democrats to Congress continues into 2020, the House and possibly the Senate might move a bit to the left. If the political landscape shifts left, Biden will too. To stitch together the Democrats as the field narrows from the current 2 dozen candidates to one, whoever the nominee is will have to give concessions to the candidates who ran a good race, but didn't go all the way. I think there are some candidates out there today who would be outstanding cabinet secretaries. For example Bernie would be great in something like Health and Human Services. 

Accept that the nominee might be more conservative than you want and do what you can to work with it. It would be great to be able to move the political needle forward in the next administration, but realistically, this country is probably going to spend 4-8 years rebuilding and healing after this disaster. We need someone who can appeal to the reasonable conservatives who see the disaster now and those who will be waking up from the cult conditioning and be rather traumatized that they got sucked in by a stupid Hitler. 

As I said above, none of the choices are perfect. Every Democratic candidate has drawbacks, but I think Biden has the broadest appeal and is least likely to scare any of the people we're going to need to win over if this country is going to heal from this.",,0,0,0,0

Hi All. I hope the below information may help someone here.

I'll be signing up with them. They are based in San Diego, CA. I've had them before and they've been the best insurance company I've used yet.

I have no interest in this matter, just thought I'd share my experience in the hopes some fellow members can save a little money.

I have a Model 3 Performance on order. And although the insurance cost for this vehicle is expensive, I can't pass up the performance this car provides. f*&$ it, we only live once, right?

Thanks for the feedback all great points. One thing I have been curious about is the tenant improvements required to run a Tesla service center. As Tesla and other electric car makers continue to grow, are there any improvements such as highly specialized electrical capacity or specialized equipment/service docks that may make these facilities attractive to other companies? (Rivian, Fisker, Lucid, etc...) Seems to me like there could be a play to re-tenant with those types of concepts?
""

In this real estate environment, I wouldn't be buying any commercial real estate right now. At least here in the Portland area we're near the top of the market right now. I've been going around on this with a partner in a building I'm invested in. He has a law practice in the building which has expanded and he's chomping at the bit to sell and find a larger building, but the office is a converted house on a major street and has a garage sitting there unused. My SO and I are pushing to convert the garage which can be done cheaply and wait for the real estate market to soften. He'd be paying nose bleed prices for anything today.

As for old Tesla facilities, rather than other car makers going in, which is problematic, there is a growing need for electric car mechanics, especially in places with high densities of electric cars. The old Tesla facilities are probably too big for mechanics shops today, but in a few years when electrics are more common, a good sized mechanic's shop might be able to fill out an old Tesla facility. I think that's going to take a fairly coordinated effort between the mechanic running the shop and the owner of the building if not the same entity. That sounds like more than you want to get involved in.

Now facilities with upgraded power installations could be used for other things. There are some industries that require lots of electricity. Any kind of computer server center would need lots of power for example. Another thing you could do is install some high power CCS chargers that use the extra power available and lease out the building for some other use.

I expect the economy is going to take a big downturn in the next year. The current business cycle has been unusually long and we're overdue for a recession. There have also been some dumb economic decisions in Washington DC lately, any one of which could tank the economy. As far as real estate goes, I would sit on the sideline right now and wait for the recession to hit, then get serious about buying. When the economy is going south, cash buyers can score some great deals with people who need to shift property fast.",,0,0,0,0

I really think I could get used to it and like it, even though I thought I wouldn’t. Well done Tesla. I also have not liked the look of them. I considered them almost ugly. But after spending time with it and looking at it more closely, I no longer think it’s ugly. They could make the nose look much better, and it still isn’t as sexy as a Model S. No contest.

So, the tech is great, battery charging rate, FSD, almost half the cost. Pound for pound I think it’s the best Tesla you can purchase for the money. Very nice car. I would be a happy owner if I had one. Really. But......

The P3D is supposed to be 0 to 6 0 in 3.2 seconds. My MS P90D is rated for 3.1. The one I tested is only about 3 months old and with less than 1300 miles. I didn’t break out the time or anything, but there IMO a very noticeable difference in performance. Going from 0 to 60 was fast on the P3D, but when I do it in my P90D, it lurches and drives you into the seat. Okay, I thought. Maybe it’s the permanent magnet motors take a little more time to get to speed and once at higher rpm, it closes the gap. I don’t think so. I ran another test going from 35 to 70 and it just didn’t have the torque of my P90D. As soon as I got back into my car I ran the same tests. It wasn’t close. Maybe I tested a lemon at the dealership? I don’t know. And I didn’t scientifically measure it. Maybe my Model S prejudices were kicking in? I really don’t think so. 

So friends, I’ve decided to go ahead and finalize the sale of my P90D, invest it for a time, then possibly purchase the new Sept release of the Model S or Raven. Whatever it is, it will not be a P3D. It will most probably be a Model S. 

All my best... Please leave your comments and share your test drive experiences with us as well.

a) Is it 2 lines right now?
b) Can they support demand with just 1? What would be the max output?
c) Would they only get 1 line for the Y out of this? Could they also add more floor space for a 2nd?

Ultimately the ideal scenario is for N.American factories to support N.America, and so on. The 7k/week for the model 3 current output just for N.America is a pretty ambitious number long-term.

Not quite... you're talking about a resisitive heater that has the following design bits:

Can take up to ~50-100kW of power instantaneously (that's what regen is)
Has a way to funnel all that power back to the coolant without it immediately vaporizing
Can handle being cycled between 0kW to 100kW to 0kW instantly over and over.
If you don't have that, then the brake feel will be weird and mushy and you won't be able to do it for long. If there was a way to actually do that in a reasonable manner, they'd have designed something like that for heating the car too. Think of how much less power you'd have to burn if you could just heat the car via braking.

3703276,Papafox's Daily TSLA Trading Charts,Papafox,2019-05-29 18:16:00,"Today was a battleground between shorts and longs, just as with yesterday, but even with noticeably worse macros today TSLA managed to close in the green, giving longs one more victory in the effort to end the downtrend and set up for a bounce. The day began with macro futures looking bad and thus we saw pre-market trading in the red. Prices rose as market trading approached however. Then at 9:34am the shorts dumped 90K shares in one minute, spiking the SP downward but only for a moment, and when this brief MMD was defeated TSLA quickly rose into the green.

If you compare the TSLA chart with the NASDAQ chart, you'll see there was quite a bit of correlation between the rising and falling of each today. My guess: shorty using the NASDAQ dips as an excuse to push harder downward and then working to cap the peaks so that they didn't exceed 190 for too long. It was all about 190 today and I have put a transparent grey line at that level so that the gameplay is all the clearer.

A little before 11am as the NASDAQ declined further, shorty managed to push TSLA down to below 190 and we see horizontal trading there until TSLA broke lower as the NASDAQ continued to drop. The 1:30pm rise dissipated below 190, a brief run upwards above 190 was neutralized, and then then final climb of the day was capped just below 190 for 11 minutes before it climbed higher and then was led down for a close slightly below 190.

Folks, it's psychological gamesmanship. Nonetheless, shorty expected to see red when everything else was trading negatively today and when it became apparent that TSLA would close in the green, shorty expended the resources necessary to get TSLA to close just 0.14 below 190.

The good news is that after-hours trading was on a positive trend, which will hopefully be reflected in tomorrow's trading.



The NASDAQ opened low (as did the DOW) and closed down 0.79%

Overall, TSLA did well today, closing 1.4% higher than the Nasdaq.

News that helped TSLA today was another leaked Email from Elon to the employees. Here's a CNBC version. Musk emphasized continued demand and the need for getting lots of vehicles delivered efficiently before quarter's end. He still see's exceeding 90,700 deliveries in Q2 as a possibility.

Another important news story was that Fremont will be the location for the manufacture of Model Y and that Model S will see a refresh in September. Here's an electrek version of the story. The idea is to move the Model S body in white to the Model X body in white line in order to make room for Model Y. Both S and X already share a final production line.

Meanwhile, CleanTechnica has this excellent story of how Q1 was just a dip in demand and how demand is noticeably stronger in Q2 again.

So, who's going to win the battle to reverse TSLA's trend here, shorts or longs? The trophy is very much up for grabs as Tesla continues to show strength as investors question the over-the-top negativity of last week and leaked Elon emails suggest that Tesla is actually doing pretty well in Q2. Working in favor of the shorts would be macro disruptions (that seem all too common lately) and whether the bears can generate any new FUD that was as successful as the Morgan Stanley and Citi excruciatingly low price targets of last week.




Looking at the tech chart, you can see that today's green day won't exactly sweep a chartist off his or her feet, but it's an important start to ending this price erosion.

Conditions:
* Dow down 221 (0.87%)
* NASDAQ down 60 (0.79%)
* TSLA 189.86, up 1.16 (0.61%)

2014 Model S 85.
firmware 2019.16.1.1 697c2ff
En-Route battery warm up was specifically mentioned in the release notes when I recently updated.

This early morning I headed to a supercharger with a cold battery power limiter was visible from the start. Through CAN bus data I monitored the battery temperature and battery heater activity the entire time. The battery heater did not turn on the entire drive.

I plugged in at the supercharger and the power was lower than what I would normally see. Sure enough, the battery heater kicked in shortly after I plugged in. It stayed on until the battery had reached aprox 28 C (82 F). I have seen this behavior many times before, long before the recent software update. When charging at a supercharger and the battery is not warm enough, it will turn on the battery heater to warm up the battery.

Clearly the battery needed to be warmer for best supercharging speed, yet the car did not warm up the battery on the drive. Only once the car was plugged in did the active heater kick in. Now I'm not saying it doesn't work at all. It most probably works just fine for Model 3 and 100 Model S/X. I assume they just don't bother making changes to the old cars.
""

How far did you drive and what was the starting SoC? If you navigate to a supercharger close enough, you should be able to start the battery heater while parked.

I think it's likely that if you start driving not quite far away enough, and with low enough SoC, that by the time it wants to heat the battery as you're approaching the SC because your battery is still cold, you will have too low SoC to do so.",,0,0,0,0

Warning to all longs:

The macros look really sucky. The timing is not very good for TSLA unfortunately, a situation that can be argued is very much self inflicted. 

But ask yourself this: If the S and P and QQQs drop thirty percent in the next six months, where does that put TSLA? How about fifty percent? I have been through brutal bear markets before, and there are no favorites played. All stocks will be dumped, and ‘speculative’ plays like TSLA get obliterated. We are starting from a low point with much technical damage.

This should not change anything on a five to ten year horizon, but you can get crushed before you ever see that. The only way to protect yourself is to either have budgeted for a 100% loss or to use absolutely zero margin.

Can you withstand a double digit stock price? How about a sub 50? Trust me, I am getting sick writing this. Even after the fifty percent haircut TSLA is still my largest holding by far.

I am looking for TSLA specific catalysts to turn the tide, and they should be there, but no one pays any attention to that when recession hits. They sell everything relentlessly and then jump back in when the prices get to the point where even good companies with profits are priced for bankruptcy.

Would love nothing more than to be a contrarian indicator here. I genuinely believe that Tesla is destroying the competition which is why the pushback has been so vitriolic and fierce. This China factory is being treated like a negative, when any auto company in the world would kill for the same deal and progress. This is the way our world works.... which is why we are in such a goddamn mess.

All the best and good luck!

Respectfully disagree with the bolder part above - there are plenty of winning stocks in past bear markets, and Tesla is also no longer the “Speculation play”i t used to be 5+ years ago - today it earns enough revenue and operating cashflow, and is growing at a rate to warrant a market cap in the tens of billions.",,0,0,0,0

I almost made it but the Autopilot Computer crashed after about 3 hours or 170 miles into the drive at 2:54:46 so I had to take over once.

This is a first time that I tried this feature on a long trip and I am quite impressed with it considering it's still beta and a driver has to babysit the system at all times!

There were close calls or brainless maneuvers that I would normally take over but I just wanted to see how the system works without my intervention.

More than 200 miles for almost 5 hours with Navigation on Autopilot with 1 disengagement due to an Autopilot computer crash (which temporarily disabled the Autopilot system).

It seemed to be polite to move out of the passing lane at 70 MPH to join cars in a slower lane and let faster cars passed it then it would then continue to join the passing lane to pass cars in slower lane.

As usual, it also handled may road constructions very well including entering into the physically wrong lane that's temporarily redirected for construction.

I knew I was in the wrong side of the road because the road sign was pointing for cars driving in the opposite direction:

Yes - the car had more issues. I started to get good at fixing it though, lol. I figured out that if I disconnected and reconnected the 12V battery I could basically do a hard reset and make the car drive-able. Also, if I was having issues shifting the car into drive I would toggle tow mode and that would fix it.

Anyway, long story short, Tesla ended up flying two engineers from Fremont out to my service center and they still couldn't figure out what was happening. They ended up taking really good care of me though - I was given a brand new Model S P100D with Ludicrous for three months while they worked on my model 3. And when I say brand new, I mean I literally peeled the plastic off the car with the Service Manager! Obviously I told them to take their time with the Model 3 haha. In the end - the issue could not be consistently reproduced and Tesla asked if they could buy the car from me to take it back to Fremont and strip it down. I really wanted a performance AWD model 3 anyway so I obviously said yes. Tesla let me drive the Model S P100D for another few months until the P3D was in production - even after they repurchased my original model 3. 

Many months later I read something about loose grounding bolts in early Model 3's causing issues like this. If I were to guess I think this would explain the intermittent problems I had.

All in all the experience was definitely annoying but I feel like I came out ahead and Tesla really took good care of me. My service manager was amazing, I had his personal cell number and he would call me frequently with updates. 

The good news is - not one issue with my new model 3 that I have been driving for almost a year now. Many long road trips and 12,000 miles under my belt.

My first example is a one lane bridge that I cross on my way home from work every day. This is a fairly busy road, and as you'll see in the video, traffic backs up in both directions waiting their turn to cross the bridge. There is an interesting flow to the traffic - sometimes one car from each direction goes at a time, other times a group of two or three cars will go across at once (which then prompts a similar number to cross from the other side). There are all kinds of non-obvious clues and patterns as to whose turn it is to cross the bridge.

How would a self-driving car handle this situation? First of all, how would it know that this was a one lane bridge that allowed traffic in both directions? The 'Yield to Oncoming Traffic' sign might give it a clue, assuming FSD will eventually be able to read and interpret these signs. If it were approaching the bridge and there was no traffic coming the other way, presumably it would recognize the bridge as drivable space and cross with no issue. What if a car was coming the other direction? Would it know that they both couldn't 'fit'? If cars were taking turns, would it know to wait when it was at the front of the line?

It’s hard to put that feeling into words, but the evasive maneuver was so sudden, so foreign and so frightening that I didn’t use AP for a couple of days.

Today I did notice when I tap the button to save a clip while in motion, those clips are viewable along with the sentry vids. But the clips of the car while in motion are never viewable. I do hold the camera icon down for a few seconds until the splash before removing. I have not waited 20sec after the splash nor will I be pressing the camera icon before exiting the car everytime. 

I'm on 2019.16.2, formatted FAT32 on Win10 w/Bootice, 64gb Transcend high endurance dashcam sdcard. I did partition it to add a 5gb music drive, but then repartitioned it back to a single 64gb drive thinking maybe recording video while driving and listening to music from the same usb was too much for one port to handle. I also have an old Seagate 250gb hd I've been experimenting with and I get the exact same corruption after about 2 days of use. Neither of the drives were even remotely close to being full.

I'm viewing on Win10 PC with the latest version of Potplayer, and I have tried the latest version of VLC.

Any ideas what could be wrong?

3703347,Did the Model 3 kill the Model S and the Model X and Tesla with them?,Magellan55,2019-05-29 18:48:00,"Seemed natural to me that once the 3 was in sufficient supply the MS sales would fall - so many people went over their budget for years to buy a MS because it was the only decent EV on the market. I was surprised it took until 1Q19 for MS sales to fall. I'm actually kind of glad - keeps my MS a rare sight in town.

For those that don't know anyone that prefers an S over a 3, just check out the forum - plenty of people including myself discussed having a reservation for a 3 until we saw / drove them back to back and upgraded to the S. Maybe it is a status thing for some. Most of us would agree however, that the 3 is the better value. Just like the Audi S4 is a better value than an S7, but some people still buy the S7.

Not sure I'd call the MS design dated, even at 7 years old. I still get people stopping me in all sorts of places. Last week, having lunch at a Taco Bell with my daughter, an old woman came up to us, and asked if that ""gorgeous red car"" in the parking lot was ours. She said it was the most exotic car she'd ever seen. Last month, sitting at a crosswalk at the local college waiting for some students to cross, a group of college girls took a selfie with my car. My favorite is when young kids (boys and girls) excitedly point at my car and yell ""Tesla"" to their parents as I drive by them. The new generation knows the future when they see it. I'm sure others have similar stories, whether S, X or 3.

Interior not so much, though I really enjoy the dash design and the cream / oak combination - both selling points for me over the 3. Beyond the screens, the 3's interior is definitely more ergonomic.",,0,0,0,0

Respectfully disagree with the bolded part above - there are plenty of winning stocks in past bear markets, and Tesla is also no longer the “Speculation play”i t used to be 5+ years ago - today it earns enough revenue and operating cashflow, and is growing at a rate to warrant a market cap in the tens of billions.

I totally agree. Which is why I have way too much in TSLA and am feeling the pain. But when the SHTF, what matters is whether or not Mr. Market thinks it is a speculative play. What do you think Mr Market’s opinion is at the moment?

I've got a trip coming up in a week -- I'll be driving from the Plantation, FL Supercharger to Tampa Airport along I75 the whole way. Sunday evening trip -- usually very little traffic. I usually stop along the way and supercharge, but if you guys want some data, I can charge all the way up and go for it in one shot. 2019 05/19 build P3D stock 20"".

I'm pretty flexible in the actual drive time, so happy to stick to whatever you guys would want me to try out as far as speed, A/C, AP...

I usually pee halfway through too, so I guess I'll bring an extra bottle...
""

Well, obviously it's up to you! If it's raining or windy I wouldn't worry about doing an experiment. 

I do think you'll want to supercharge in Tampa if you try to make it in one shot though...no good to leave the battery on empty even for a short time...and it would be tragic if you miss your flight or something in the name of ""science."" I guess I'm assuming you're catching a flight.

Supercharger to Supercharger it is 252 miles which you should be able to make if you go 65mph. 70mph, not 100% sure. 

Even if it makes more sense for you to Supercharge midway through for whatever reason, decent segment lengths at a consistent speed are good data, even if it is not a 100% to 0% discharge.

Whatever you decide, if you decide you want to gather data, do:
1) Reset a trip meter before leaving and 
2) Pictures! (Before starting each segment (even if you just took a picture when you stopped) & just as you stop, immediately after putting into park...) Pictures of the screen should include: 
a) the rated miles (not %) and time/temp 
b) The cumulative relevant trip meter data 
c) The specific ""segment"" (since entering driver's seat and putting in drive) trip data. 

That rated-mile use in particular is interesting in combination with the trip meter data, even if you have variable speeds, conditions, etc. There's not really another way to see what you're really on target for. 

If you have a GPS app capable of producing an accessible track log with elevation & speed profile, that's helpful to grab for each segment too. Though in Florida the elevation is less significant... I'd recommend Gaia GPS, but actually its ability to actually make good use of the elevation and speed profile is really limited (can't zoom and scale, etc., at least on the app).",,0,0,0,0

I've seen a few references to the idea that there are 2 S/X lines right now and that Tesla will have to remove 1 to put in a Y line. What are the thoughts on the accuracy of the various parts of this claim?

a) Is it 2 lines right now?
b) Can they support demand with just 1? What would be the max output?
c) Would they only get 1 line for the Y out of this? Could they also add more floor space for a 2nd?

Ultimately the ideal scenario is for N.American factories to support N.America, and so on. The 7k/week for the model 3 current output just for N.America is a pretty ambitious number long-term. I can see moving S/X equipment to Shanghai if it is removed from Fremont (right? that seems obvious?). It would be nice to see Tesla move on a Europe plant. Man this stock drop is p*ss*ng me off. I'd vastly prefer they be going all out on cap.ex and the market cap still high on promises and hope. Elon has claimed that cap.ex spend is not slowing them down but I don't believe him. A Europe factory makes sense pronto.

That's a lot of solar, plus the batteries! How long have you had the solar panels? Installed same time as batteries? If you've never cleaned them, is your peak power still as high as its always been?

What level do you keep the batteries? How often do they drain completely? Do they charge to full every day? every week? every month? How much power do you store and then use from the batteries daily, on average? You can tell I'm very curious how the batteries work.
""

We've had solar a bit over 10 years. The output this year is right on par with the first year. There are ups and downs in production due to weather conditions, but any degradation of the panels or inverters is minimal and cannot be seen in the average output. Our battery system was only installed this year. It is for backup purposes only as we are on a flat rate plan. They stay at 99% charge. When configured as backup power only, there is no user-adjustment for the battery charge. It always tops off in the morning when the sun hits the panels and drains 1-2% overnight, whether due to inherent losses or by design I do not know.

3703394,A mighty effort from AEVA Tasmania,Chuq,2019-05-29 19:12:00,"A few updates 

1) Chargefox announced their intention to build an ultra-rapid site (350kW) in Campbell Town by the end of the year. Discussed further in the Chargefox thread - ChargeFox Ultra Rapid Network (350kW/HPC)

2) The State Government announced grants for destination chargers and DC fast chargers in Tasmania. The interesting part is the fast charger portion, with $400,000 funding available, and grants available of up to $50,000 per site.

Applications closed last week, and at the AEVA meeting last night it was suggested there was significantly more interest than expected. I was attending via Skype and audio was unclear but it sounded like there were >15 applications.

Clive volunteered the information that they (Electric Highway Tasmania) put in applications for 6 sites, along the north-west, west coast and east coast. Their logic being that they were aware of either concrete or tentative intentions for either councils or other commercial entities to build out other parts of the state, so they only applied for the regional areas which are less commercially viable.

3) Mood Food at Kempton has installed a 50kW fast charger! Kempton is about 50 km north of Hobart, 150 km south of Launceston. (When Campbell Town goes in, the gaps will be 50km, 82km, 68km). I only noticed this on Plugshare today so not a lot of info available!

Interestingly enough, I notice the charger is labelled ""Bolt by Bennetts"" (Bennetts being a local company which operates fuel distribution as as well about 12 service stations in Tasmania.

I always wondered how the trip routing feature to ""end range anxiety"" would work for the people that didn't get the tech package/GPS Navigation. Apparently not very well. 
""

I've actually been fine doing manual calculations for the previous 3.5 years of ownership. Take distance * 1.3 for a safety margin, +1 for each 100 foot elevation rise or -1 for each 50 foot elevation fall between start and end of trip. Only issue I've had is through the wind farm in Coachella Valley, if it's a strong headwind I've not quite made it to the next charger a couple times even after adding extra safety margin the first time it happened. Ack. Luckily Morongo Casino has CHAdeMO. I actually arrived there both times with 0RM. Pretty stressful.

GPS nav does save time doing the manual calcs. I don't think GPS nav includes headwinds either but I think it's more conservative than my calc so I would have charged longer and it would have made it clearer earlier that we weren't going to make the next supercharger.

Chademo adapter for model 3 coming.

Tesla Will Offer CHAdeMO Adapter For US Model 3 Owners ""Soon"" | CleanTechnica
""

I wonder if this will be able to use higher amperage CHAdeMO chargers (if they ever get widely deployed). Part of CHAdeMO's claimed charge rate is using voltages beyond what Teslas can use, but there is a newer flavor of the standard that supposedly can also do higher amperage which if it can do higher amperage at lower voltage would be less terrible. The original CHAdeMO standard, when used with Teslas, could only provide 50kW of power which is better than high-amp L2 AC charging but not by a lot compared to DCFC like Supercharger.

While I'm fine with a CHAdeMO adapter being released for those that want it, I'd rather see a Type 1 CCS adapter for S/X/3/... you're more likely to get a better charge rate out of it, if you're having to make do with 3rd party charging.",,0,0,0,0

**I suppose it's possible that both EA and Tesla will install at this Walmart in San Antonio. I've seen some documentation which says 8 EV chargers and some which says 10 EV chargers being installed there. While I think this most likely just represents a minor plan change or an error/typo, I'm willing to concede that there's still a small possibility that it actually represents different installs, one for each company.

Both name and description argue against it being active. And even if it were active, I don't see any reason to use an ultracap. Truly active suspension could overwhelm a regular 12v battery. That's why Maxwell markets their ultracaps to ICE carmakers as the best energy storage option for active suspension. But the power levels are nothing compared to accelerating and regeneratively braking a 2+ ton car. Tesla's big batteries can handle those kind of loads in their sleep.
""

Could be simply that it was cheaper to use the supercaps with lower gauge wiring than to use higher gauge wiring to direct feed the necessary power, especially if it otherwise meant adding more HV (perhaps not ~400V pack level, but more than 12V) connections to the battery pack to make the wiring size reasonable.",,0,0,0,0

Well, obviously it's up to you! If it's raining or windy I wouldn't worry about doing an experiment. 

I do think you'll want to supercharge in Tampa if you try to make it in one shot though...no good to leave the battery on empty even for a short time...and it would be tragic if you miss your flight or something in the name of ""science."" I guess I'm assuming you're catching a flight.

Supercharger to Supercharger it is 252 miles which you should be able to make if you go 65mph. 70mph, not 100% sure. 

Even if it makes more sense for you to Supercharge midway through for whatever reason, decent segment lengths at a consistent speed are good data, even if it is not a 100% to 0% discharge.

Whatever you decide, if you decide you want to gather data, do:
1) Reset a trip meter before leaving and
2) Pictures! (Before starting each segment (even if you just took a picture when you stopped) & just as you stop, immediately after putting into park...) Pictures of the screen should include: 
a) the rated miles (not %) and time/temp
b) The cumulative relevant trip meter data
c) The specific ""segment"" (since entering driver's seat and putting in drive) trip data. 

That rated-mile use in particular is interesting in combination with the trip meter data, even if you have variable speeds, conditions, etc. There's not really another way to see what you're really on target for. 

If you have a GPS app capable of producing an accessible track log with elevation & speed profile, that's helpful to grab for each segment too. Though in Florida the elevation is less significant... I'd recommend Gaia GPS, but actually its ability to actually make good use of the elevation and speed profile is really limited (can't zoom and scale, etc., at least on the app). TeslaFi captures this data apparently, if you have it.

I live near the airport, so just heading home, no worries about missing a flight. There are a few SCs along the end of the trip; I'd be able to detour if needed. Going to the St Pete Supercharger should be pretty safe.

Just had some relatives over for lunch and wanted to relay a story. We were discussing EV's and Tesla and my cousin said: ""I heard they are going bankrupt"". He also went on to say they would never have a car near $35k so I took him to the website and we pretended to order a Model 3. We had the entire family gathered around my laptop where I preceded to pull up the standard range Model 3 with no options (Black, stock wheels, black interior and no autopilot) ... total was $39,900 and I told them they could still get $3750 in tax credits. Brings us to $36,150 .... which seemed to shock them. Not sure if they get any additional incentives from their state (TX) but even without any additional incentives they were pleasantly surprised. The next thing he said was: "" yeah but when will I get the car? I heard they were really backed up"" .... I told him it wouldn't be out of the question to get it in a few weeks. I'm not exactly sure but I'm under the impression that what I told him was accurate. Of course there was also the question about range and where to charge ....

All of which tells me that once again Tesla has to do a better job of educating the average consumer ... I know Elon's not a fan of advertising but I think Tesla needs to give it serious consideration ... just to educate the public.

Well, they've really stepped to far this time. I am livid.

I've been actively rejecting V9.0 updates to my car since V8.1-2018.18. The last time my car had an update was over a year ago (see EV-FW info below).

But overnight my car got updated.. and much to my horror, shock, and surprise this morning when got in the car, I was greeted with the standard update notice and V9. 

Keep in mind that I got home with 11% charge and forgot to plug-in. And my car has not connected to Wi-fi in over a year. 

Now I'm not going to go into all ""entitled"" mode and say I'm going to sue Tesla or start a class-action lawsuit or assault the local service center to roll it back. Because (a) I'm not that kind of person, and (2), I know it's pointless.

I'm just stinking mad that I now have to suffer with the utter bullcrap software that is V9.

The only upside is that now I don't have to be afraid to go in for service. My charge port door was throwing some errors last week, but it resolved itself. Oh yeah, and Teslatari. Woot.

I don't think I ever really posted a final update as I didn't want any posts to get back to those involved - this has been over a year now.

Yes - the car had more issues. I started to get good at fixing it though, lol. I figured out that if I disconnected and reconnected the 12V battery I could basically do a hard reset and make the car drive-able. Also, if I was having issues shifting the car into drive I would toggle tow mode and that would fix it.

Anyway, long story short, Tesla ended up flying two engineers from Fremont out to my service center and they still couldn't figure out what was happening. They ended up taking really good care of me though - I was given a brand new Model S P100D with Ludicrous for three months while they worked on my model 3. And when I say brand new, I mean I literally peeled the plastic off the car with the Service Manager! Obviously I told them to take their time with the Model 3 haha. In the end - the issue could not be consistently reproduced and Tesla asked if they could buy the car from me to take it back to Fremont and strip it down. I really wanted a performance AWD model 3 anyway so I obviously said yes. Tesla let me drive the Model S P100D for another few months until the P3D was in production - even after they repurchased my original model 3. 

Many months later I read something about loose grounding bolts in early Model 3's causing issues like this. If I were to guess I think this would explain the intermittent problems I had.

All in all the experience was definitely annoying but I feel like I came out ahead and Tesla really took good care of me. My service manager was amazing, I had his personal cell number and he would call me frequently with updates. 

The good news is - not one issue with my new model 3 that I have been driving for almost a year now. Many long road trips and 12,000 miles under my belt.

But buying used is always a risk, it takes considerable time and energy, and I never found exactly the car I would have wanted. (I will admit to having been very particular.) I had read all too many truly horrible stories of difficult and unsatisfying experiences with buying used cars through Tesla. I ended up concluding that whatever premium I was paying would be worth it in the sense of keeping a car we liked and avoiding the time and effort to locate something else. 

Since then, however, it seems as if prices of used cars have fallen further, and people seem to be getting incredible deals on inventory cars. So, if I had the money and had the opportunity again, my decision might have been different. 

By the way, I also had a lease through US Bank, and would comment that buying out the lease from them was not as easy as one might have expected. They should be making it easy, right? After all, it saves them from having to sell a car. But their process has some pain points, and it took me an unreasonable amount of time, especially after they made some blunders in the paperwork.

Sorry if I confused you. Last week or so I received 2 phone calls inquiring about discount for group of 3 people if they come together. So we created that bundle deal and shared with everyone. The deal is that we give better price on tinting when 3 Opti-Coat Pro Plus packages purchased by the same group of 3. In previous post I just wanted to mention that It is not a discount on coating and different offer for bigger group.

I also have no AP, and I do have LDA and ELDA. It's just hard to activate; to me it feels like it's really only meant for scenarios where the driver is unconscious. LDA will activate when: 1. Your blinker isn't on. 2. You are not applying torque to the steering wheel. 3. Your car passes pretty far over a recognized lane line. I think ELDA has similar criteria, but also require sensing something hit-able you're drifting into.

I can understand why you think you don't have it, though. Reading some of the ""false-positive"" stories on here you'd think it activates every 30 seconds.

Hi h - Just did a 412 mile round trip test drive to the Kettleman City Superchargers today. Only 5 of the 40 superchargers were occupied. Had the barista made coffee drinks and bought a long sleeve t-shirt.

I had ELDA activated and did not get any warning chimes or touchscreen display message alerts. What problems were you experiencing ? Wifi and LTE works the same as before. Only used NOA for about a third of the trip and then went back to steering on my own because of all the potholes on I-5. Sentry mode worked as expected, although I did get an alert there was one sentry mode event. Is there a way to specifically search what the event was or when it happened ? Didn't have time to check all the video clips yet, but didn't see any body damage. The update seems okay to me so far, but it has been only a day since I got it.

3703581,SR+ vs LR RWD. How much more pain on a long trip?,nightfly,2019-05-29 20:27:00,"I recently went through the same decision process: SR+ vs LR RWD. I did the ""Better Route Planner"" thing for a couple of long range trips I anticipated - and in that comparison, I decided the SR+ was sufficient.

Like you I figured 80-90% of my driving would be under 100 miles round trip and the every month or so ~200 mile trip and the SR/SR+ would do.

Then I learned about charging rate differences between LR and SR versions. 
Then I learned about ""wait lines"" at super chargers at busy locations; especially during holidays, weekend, etc.
I've been driving electric cars for 6 years now and have had range anxiety. It's not as bad now as there's far more options - but 'time to charge"" on a non-super charger, is well, not a desired factor of any trip.
I have a 7 year old son - long car trips are not his or any kids ""thing"". They want to get to destination.

Then the price adjustment happened for the Model 3 where the LR RWD with Autopilot actually became $1400 dollars cheaper.

So the net price difference for me was $6400 between SR+ and LR RWD (I got the SR+ order in before $400 price increase) over 5 years is $106/month. $53/month over 10 years (I tend to keep my cars 10 years-ish)

Was spending $106 more a month over the term of a loan worth:

Better features (sound, nav, etc.)
Much faster charging rates generally
Ability to skip a charge or two on a trip (and thus bypass a busy charger station so I don't to go to far out of the way or wait in line to charge)
Get to destinations generally much quicker so that I don't get much of the ""...are we there yet. I'm so bored...""
Less likely to have range anxiety; especially during less than ideal weather conditions
Definitely I decided. Perhaps as much of 80+% of the time it would matter, but that 20% of the time it would very much. So I changed my SR+ to an LR RWD order and haven't regretted it yet.

And yes the difference between ""premium"" and ""near premium"" interiors is mostly fluff, but I actually like having those features. I just setup homelink tonight and it's quite nice...

So ask yourself, does $100 a month really matter?",,0,0,0,0

It is...my service adviser, and as many owners will tell you, that driving on the low setting changes the camber which promotes bettering handling, but wears the inner side of the tire quicker.

I think it was more a problem in earlier RWD only vehicles but have seen complaints across all trim levels.

Has anyone gotten a substantial discount on a model with all the current features with ~5 miles on the odo after March? I guess I saw some folks got a free exterior color or free 19” wheels if there was a near-match car in inventory.

I feel like virtually all the big deals in April/May have been on 2018 or demo cars... I’m not even clear on the March crush of discounts — were those largely 2018s also?

When I was in line in April I asked around two service centers and was offered three discounted cars, but all with more miles on the odo. One I know was a test drive car, the others I’m not sure but may have been. The discounts were modest. I held out for the HW3 in my desired color scheme.

It doesn’t happen every quarter end, only when Tesla is really trying to make sales targets. Then the inventory cars with 7 miles on them discounted a ton show up.

Most two car households do this. The first EV becomes the preferred car with the old ICE becoming the backup car. We did this. For a while EVs will displace about 1.5 to 1.9 cars worth of oil demand in two car households... Until the second car is replaced with an EV too.
""

Yes, my family too, but we moved to buy a second Model S within a year of the first. Tomorrow we will trade in that S for a new X. We may name the back ext/white int X, Henri. 

But I digress. This phenomena is particularly important for understanding the impact of fleet EVs like EV buses. If you look at the chart in the article I linked, you can see that diesel demand peaked in 2014 in China and has been in steady decline. So much is compatible with diesel buses being replaced with EVs and natgas vehicles. But diesel demand is volatile and seasonal. I think that there are reasons why heavy duty EVs could amplify seasonality and other volatility in addition to causing average consumption to decline. So it has everything to do with fuel powered vehicles playing a backup role to EVs in fleets. The backup vehicles respond to residual demand for fleet service. 

This is dynamic I had not anticipated before, but we could see diesel and gasoline demand become much more volatile as EVs become the low opex vehicles of choice. To use a rough analogy from power generation, EVs are becoming ""baseload"" transport, while fossil powered vehicles become the ""peaking"" transport. In any case, the peaking role or backup role leads to much more seasonality and volatility of fuel demand.",,0,0,0,0

Has anyone else experienced this? Am I doing more damage by driving this the way it is till my appointment in June (2 weeks away)? Any Suggestions?

None of the Democratic candidates really leap out at me as the person I really want to see as president. Ultimately we all need to be pragmatists. Psychologically a large swath of the American public is very traumatized right now. The capriciousness of the current president along with his constantly changing messaging is driving a lot of people nuts. My SO is both a lawyer and a Psychologist and she's seeing a lot of people showing signs of severe stress over the current political situation.

When people are stressed, they run to the known over the unknown. There are quite a number of Republicans who are traumatized by Trump who have expressed that Biden would be an acceptable choice for them. A lot of independents will probably be looking for a known quantity in 2020 too. If he could run again, I wouldn't be surprised if Barack Obama could win a third term quite easily.

Biden doesn't have the greatest track record, but he has expressed regret at many of the legislative blunders he's made. He also has demonstrated he changes with the times too. He's always been a tick left of center, wherever the ""center"" has wandered over the decades.

Trump is most nervous about Biden because Biden puts the biggest dent in the constituency he needs to win re-election. Biden appeals to the same rural, white Democrats that Bill Clinton appealed to.

This is a very good article that shows the differences between the majority of Democrats and the most vociferous Democrats:
The Democratic Electorate on Twitter Is Not the Actual Democratic Electorate

Biden is ahead in the polls because the quiet majority of Democrats are seeking a known quantity rather than the bold new thing.

Presidential campaigns often listen to people who take the time to write in. I suggest a number of us write the Biden campaign and let them know who Jim Chanos really is and what he's been trying to do. You might see Biden distance himself from him.

If the trends in electing Democrats to Congress continues into 2020, the House and possibly the Senate might move a bit to the left. If the political landscape shifts left, Biden will too. To stitch together the Democrats as the field narrows from the current 2 dozen candidates to one, whoever the nominee is will have to give concessions to the candidates who ran a good race, but didn't go all the way. I think there are some candidates out there today who would be outstanding cabinet secretaries. For example Bernie would be great in something like Health and Human Services. 

Accept that the nominee might be more conservative than you want and do what you can to work with it. It would be great to be able to move the political needle forward in the next administration, but realistically, this country is probably going to spend 4-8 years rebuilding and healing after this disaster. We need someone who can appeal to the reasonable conservatives who see the disaster now and those who will be waking up from the cult conditioning and be rather traumatized that they got sucked in by a stupid Hitler. 

As I said above, none of the choices are perfect. Every Democratic candidate has drawbacks, but I think Biden has the broadest appeal and is least likely to scare any of the people we're going to need to win over if this country is going to heal from this.
""

Sorry, but Biden's too old school. The old way of thinking/politicking isn't going to lead to any progressive change. Obama tried to work with a republican congress, and nothing meaningful got done other than a slow rescue of the economy - even universal healthcare was a compromise.

At the rate things are going, we'll be in a full blown recession just around election time. The new president is going to have a basket-case of an economy to deal with, and a Green New Deal is what's needed to lead the way out of it, not saving infrastructure companies that would be considered too big to fail.",,0,0,0,0

↑

I won't suggest using a cylindrical wire. Cross section would be most likely rectangular.

Heat capacity of copper: 38.5J/degC per 100g
1J = 0.000277778 Wh
23.6kg / 100g * 38.5J / degC * 0.000277778 Wh/J = 2.524 Wh/degC
P=100kW
Temperature change of the copper wire in 1 second = 100kW / 2.524 Wh/degC /3600 = 11 deg C / second
In 5 seconds and braking by 100kW the wire's temperature changes by 55 deg C. Then this heat has couple of minutes to flow into the cells until the next braking.

This looks totally doable to me. However it adds weight and cost. These can be reduced by using different material. And most likely the electric heater is cheaper but slower.



pretty simple modification



I'm braking and battery is cold so I can't store the energy elsewhere. Not sure what efficiency are you referring to? Anything that went into the wire is warming the battery.
It adds weight though. Just by looking at the numbers, sizing the system to 50kW the weight could come down. Adding a heater like in Model S adds weight as well.
""

I think you're underestimating how often you need to brake and the amount of power that's added to a system here. If I only get one brake every few minutes before you heat soak the wire, it's next to useless. I'd say at minimum you need to be able to handle 30 seconds of braking before any sort of 'cooldown' period.",,0,0,0,0

We financially reached for the dual motor as we were originally planning on buying the standard M3 but at the time it looked like it was going to be an even longer wait and the dual motor just became available that June. 

We paid Tesla 54k , no autopilot, black, this is the peak retail of what customers paid for a M3dm to Tesla. Today every M3 is sold w/autopilot standard (except supposedly the standard) for safety reasons and for less. And yet the early adopters of the M3 have not received an update activating the new version of Autopilot to the early M3 owners.

I’m mad in the fact this group is being overlooked/ignored by Tesla. We gave deposits on good faith, helped Tesla get these cars into production. I tried to call my advisor in Las Vegas and couldn’t get through. Relayed my frustration to my local dealer in Dedham MA. I was told the message would be relayed to the general manager. I have yet to receive a follow up call. 

Am I wrong? Do other owners feel the same way? Sorry for the long post.

You gave some very specific details (too much to just be a guess), and the Ravens are exactly what you said we'd be getting. I'm guessing you'll be right about the interior as well.

Just a cautious note to others: Don't treat that Electrek article or CNBC article as confirmation, they might be using CraZ8's postings as their source (or might be using CraZ8's friend as their source). We just don't know. But even without Electrek/CNBC I still think CraZ8 has reliable info. Several people, including myself, are adjusting their $100K purchases based on your heads up. We would have been pretty bummed if we jumped too soon and missed out on some good stuff. I'd like to see the new interior before deciding, but personally I'm expecting to hate the new interior. I will probably grab an inventory car with the old interior once the new interior is revealed. Would love to be wrong, would love to like the new interior. We'll see. Having HUD or 360 birds eye view could easily sway me.

It seems like some people on here are assuming that the free Ludicrous will end with the interior refresh. Why do some people think this? I'm more inclined to think it's permanent. In fact, I think it'll just become free for anybody (even new buyers). The 100D is quicker than it used to be, and cheaper than it used to be, so the P100DL performance delta is smaller than ever now. It's pretty obvious by the new prices that Model S demand doesn't support those old $150K prices, Tesla has exhausted all the rich folk who'd spend that kind of money. Just my opinion, of course. I just don't think that cost cutting measures on the interior (resulting in a more minimalist interior) is going allow Tesla to raise the prices back up. Would love to hear other's thoughts regarding if/when the free Ludicrous goes away, and if so, what the new Ludicrous price is going to be.",,0,0,0,0

Think it depends on if you like the current interior layout with the two screens more like a conventional car vs the rumored switch to one centered screen like the M3. I just ordered a Raven X a little sooner then I wanted, because I like this current interior and didnt want to chance the refresh interior.
""

I loved driving the performance Model 3, but ended up buying a new P100D for just this reason .... in addition to the suspension, range and battery updates, not to mention the loyalty Ludicrous upgrade. 

Turns out I really like the screens and controls in the S; I couldn't get used to the single screen where putting up the energy graph or music blocked the map. The S has 5-6 screen zones between 2 displays, the 3 only 2-3 on one display. Also think they went a little crazy with removing buttons for things like wiindshield wipers or side mirror adjustments.

I do like the clean lines of the 3 interior, but with rumours of an S update in the fall, wanted to grab a good deal on a design I liked, rather than wait and roll the dice on an unknown S interior refresh.

I just downloaded your app today after my USB-C to USB-A OTG arrived and was looking for something to play the video. This is an awesome app so far already. I've only tried it out for a little and viewed just a few events so far but these were my initial wishes right away: a way to save video onto my phone so I can easily upload it somewhere or just to save it, viewing just 1 video feed in bigger screen (by clicking on it?), would also be cool to be able to just save/move videos of interest to a special folder. This is not your problem and more of a Tesla problem but they need to organize the videos better. They need to just have a folder or folders with all sentry mode events in there so I can easily go and look at the video that corresponds to when a specific event was triggered. Not have to open videos of me just driving and trying to find what I actually want to see. But seriously, this is awesome already! Thanks for this! I mainly wanted something like this so if my car did happen to be damaged, I can review it on my phone right away so I don't have to search very hard for it when I get home.

No, I wouldn't. Sure, it's like the OEM version for a lot less but that's where the pros end... not sure I think it's worth it after having personally bough two.

For starters, the lead times are quite long. Nothing like shelling out hundreds of dollars and waiting a month or so for something. Hell, you can order and entire Model 3 now and have it in about half the time to put it into perspective. The two that arrived had several QC issues that would have been caught if the company did any QC because they were pretty obvious. Working with ""customer service"" (I used air quotes to simulate sarcasm BTW) is a chore and they try awfully hard to ghost you if you have any issues at all. They're non-responsive and months later I'm still trying to communicate with them about these issues I had.

At this point, I would recommend biting the bullet and buying the OEM one which is better fit, finish & quality plus you can work with Americans for your order and any subsequent issues or consider one of the 3rd party options from EVANNEX or EVAMPED as a solution. They're much cheaper and from what I've experienced better fit & finish.

Just my two cents worth exactly what you paid for it though so do with that info what you wish.

Finally captured the big air pressure whoosh sound. The clip starts quiet, then the fan turns on all by itself (yes, I know the car does it's own thing, I had a S for years - but this is different).

It had been sitting in the garage about 7:30pm, plugged in quietly waiting for its 2:30am charge cycle. Then the fan (at junction of front windshield and hood) turns on about 11 minutes after being plugged in and it runs for about a 20 seconds and then you will hear a big whoosh of air, then it bleeds off to just the fan, then it goes quiet after the recording ends.

Palo Alto area a hot spot for auto burglars
Benitez, who has been on the front lines of law enforcement for nearly 30 years, said that under new laws, particularly Propositions 47 and 57, criminals are not going to jail for property crimes, and they know it.

“There is no answer, because even if we were to send our detectives out there, and do a stakeout, and we actually see the person, they’re going to run,” he said. “As soon as they jump into the car and speed off, we can’t do anything. They just speed right by us, and they can wave to us and pretty much we’ll wave back because we’re not allowed to chase a car for a property crime. “Even if you catch somebody, which is very rare, there is no punishment behind it. So that’s another layer of frustration. … It’s almost making a mockery of the entire judicial system.”

We already have a large, full-size SUV to transport our 2 kids around with, but would also like the option of using the Model 3 for short road trips as well if possible. 

The SR+ currently has the federal rebate and a much lower starting cost than the LR, so payments would be much less. However, I have always owned AWD vehicles, so driving a RWD is a bit concerning for me considering I’m in Alberta where we get big dumps of snow. I could also add FSD to the SR+ and still be paying much less than the LR without that functionality.

I found their pricing to be quite reasonable considering others quoted me well over $500 some up to $800 for the same job. (outdoor installation on a brick wall of the house in the backyard driveway)

""

I think when we talk about Elon and how he motivates his partners & employees to achieve such historic achievements we have to look at the bigger picture. 

The mission is clear. The stakes are high. We have to transform the way we do economic activity or we will have catastrophic problems as a global society. 

This is something we all feel. We all want to achieve a better living environment for ourselves, our loved ones and friends.

We have to make a change but don’t know how in such an fossil fuel monopolized world. 

Until Elon and friends decided to make the effort and put all their resources into it. An electric car company. A solar company. A rocket company. All doomed to fail, but they did it anyway. 

That’s the genesis of a mission worth being apart of. That’s the leadership you’d follow into the abyss. Not just for employees and partners, but retail investors and customers.

The success against all odds needs this to make it past our own worst demons and defensive monopolistic tendencies as a people.

This is why Tesla (as well as Elon’s and crew other companies) will continue to succeed.

Tesla’s story is all our success. It’s not just Elon’s story. It’s the employees story. The investors story. The customers story. 

It’s all our story.

So, yes, this approach is the LED in the dark of the abyss to success and transformation.",,0,0,0,0

Curious OCR1 which so cal delivery location did you use? They allowed you to inspect your car prior to signing all paperwork and final payment?

I’ve been to Burbank and Marina del Rey deliveries, both always ask for signature prior to showing you the car.

I agree they should allow you to inspect prior to anything, but hey this is Tesla, they do thing differently. And they do have a generous 7 day return policy.

Yes I’m aware you don’t need to do what the website tells you, but it may trigger the next step in having the delivery specialist contact you. In my case, I call them first, just like the OP did.
Besides what am I afraid of? or trying to protect? Tesla ripping me off? Not likely. Tesla giving me a lemon? Maybe, but there’s the return option if they don’t fix things.

Just a note on how sloppy some deliveries can be, my 1st model 3 was delivered to me without final payment. They got it eventually in a few days.

I’ve done 3 deliveries in Costa Mesa. They always try to greet me with paperwork to sign. I let them know I’ll be spending 45 minutes inspecting the car and invite them to find something else to do while they wait for me. Nobody has questioned me yet.

Yes, you can return the car if you need to. But who needs the hassle? It’s better to know that everything is OK with the car before you give them any money. If it’s not, you may have the option of being assigned another VIN right away. If you return the car you’ll wait 60 days to get your money back.

After receiving 16.2 forward collision warning was reset to early on my car. Might be same on yours.
""

I had a false positive today but I couldn't really blame my car because I actually would have reacted the same. 
The car in front of me just barely missed rear ending the car in front of him. My M3 predicted (as I would have) a collision and responded accordingly. This was at about 15 miles an hour in fairly heavy traffic. I had my follow distance set to 1 car and my car seemed to break in two phases. There was an initial break, (medium) and a secondary break (more moderate). I feel the car behind me had time to react because of this. Also no one was really going all that fast. I need to check to make sure warning wasn't set to early as yours was. I like the idea of looking as far forward as possible, but fear that it might not be ready for that just yet.

I received the letter below from PG&E regarding the billing on my account that has solar and Powerwalls. The essence is that they are implementing a change in the billing system that will detect if and when you are feeding more energy into the grid than what your solar is supposed to be producing. In my detailed NEMMT billing, there is a table labeled ""Summary Totals"". That table has columns for ""Exported to the Grid"" and ""Solar Generation Eligible for Credit"". I believe this is where any discrepancy between your actual export and your credited export would show up. On my completed true-up all the figures matched. In theory, the way Powerwalls are currently programmed in the USA, there should never be any net export in excess of the actual solar generation. I think the only cases where the Powerwalls would export into the grid would be a virtual power plant or demand response program. I don't know of any program like that active in PG&E territory.

I hope so too, but I suspect it is unrelated. My interconnect agreement had the Powerwalls classified as ""non-NEM eligible storage."" I think this means that my Powerwalls are never supposed to export to the grid. Since there's only one meter and there would be no way to distinguish whether it's solar export or battery export they use the estimated production instead since if the export exceeds solar production, it clearly must have come from the battery. It seems like time-shifting solar production would be allowed by this enforcement mechanism, though. With the new EV-A schedule, you could charge from solar until 3pm and then export all that energy from 4pm-9pm at peak rates.
""

Utilities and Tesla are doing experiments to see if Tesla can certify the energy measurements that the Tesla Powerwall Gateway makes, and those would be sufficient for billing purposes in that case.

Early 2018 was all about production hell. Nothing else mattered. After consecutive huge misses I was in wait and see mode.

In late June the now-infamous Skabooshka leaked that Model 3 was ramping toward a 5000 car week, which Tesla soon confirmed. Subsequent leaks from Skabooshka and Fred Lambert showed them sustaining close to 4k/week. I spent most of Aug/Sep mocking Seeking Alpha death cult members who predicted a massive Q3 loss and imminent BK. I explained cash would exceed 2.5b (it ended at almost 3.0b), they all said <2b with many <1b. I also estimated breakeven to ~50m profit vs. their massive loss forecasts.

I didn't expect a 300m Q3 profit, though, because I used Tesla's 15% Model 3 margin guidance. They came in over 20%, a terrific accomplishment!

Only one bull on SA predicted 300m - Ross Tessien (sp?). Even perpetually over-optimistic bulls like ValueAnalyst were in the breakeven to 150m range.

3704636,CCS adapter for Tesla: When's it gonna be?,tschmidty,2019-05-30 07:20:00,"Interesting info. So the communications would be handled by the car which is why the retrofit is needed, the adapter is a simple wire adapter, like the J1772. So theoretically they could have an ""adapter"" (barring Tesla licensing) but then you could have a tesla car plug in that is *not* compatible so who knows what would happen there. Hopefully nothing but would still be annoying. In fact it better be nothing, because you know someone will try the adapter without the retrofit.

I have heard info back and forth about V1 versus V2 but the signaling is the same as far as I can see, so for the US it would be the same. Cars would either require a retrofit or the adapter would need to be considerably more complex to handle the communications, similar to the chademo connector.",,0,0,0,0

In regards to getting a HW3 replacement for FSD, don't hold your breath. That will only happen when FSD features require HW3 and aren't possible on HW2.5 hardware.

Precisely my thought and my policy. Not worth the extra small power (from past years of experience on 3 homes), and the risk of personal injury. 

As I think we all know, there are a lot of variables at play. The main one being what kind of an area are people located. My San Francisco East bay home was getting more dirt than the one up here in Nevada where there is very little dirt and then the rain and snow do a good job of keeping them clean enough. I've also noticed in recent years that often just spraying them down does about as much improvement as wiping them off. That is on my San Diego home just one story high and I can do it from the ground. Thus having about the same effect as a heavy rain.

As a side note for the OP, you probably know this, but you really can't accurately compare one day to the next day even if it is the very next day. What I am referring to here is you don't mention the cloud coverage comparison during the two days. I have noticed in the past that ""Cloud enhancement"" can account for as much as a 10-13% boost in power during parts of the day, so you can't look at just the peak power. However, having said that, yes, I'm sure you will see a boost in power to a small degree. Lastly, I wonder if the installer said ""not to clean them"", or ""no need to clean them"". I'd guess the later.
""


I'm not sure I'm with you, but I was comparing the power produced when the cloud cover clears. So yes, I think its valid to say my peak power from the panels was 4.9kw the day before I cleaned them, and 5.5kw the day after I cleaned them. And I'm not really comparing just one day. I'm looking back and seeing the peak for many days before the cleaning was 4.9, and then for every day since they've been peaking at 5.5, so I believe its legit. 

Secondly, look at the picture showing my West facing panels. The top panel in that picture is producing 125W because its just been cleaned. The panel just below is producing 29W because it has a mop literally resting on it. None of the panels below that one have been mopped yet, and are producing 10% less power. That's pretty convincing evidence that my panels were significantly dirty and are working much better now. 

I have ordered a 20 foot long pole with a squeegee / mop attachment so I can see if I can clean the panels from the ground. I think it will work. I agree with everyone who says the risk is not worth it. If you can't clean them safely you shouldn't do it.",,0,0,0,0

The tint was done by this shop, owner name is Sarkis:

AccutintPro.com
1700 W Foothill Blvd
Ste A
Upland, CA 91786

I took the car back today as he instructed. He saw the bubble inside the car and the white spots, apparently from dust inside the tint.

He said “that’s normal”

I said... I’ve never seen that in my 20 years of getting previous cars tinted... to which he said “sigh.. I’ll take care if it for you “ with a half smile and half annoyance.

I said, do you expect me to just leave it alone? To which he replied with a smug, “I’ll take care of it for you” with a more serious tone this time

I kind of stood there, speechless. 

I was expecting an apology for having to drive back to the shop, take half day off from work just to bring the car back because of THEIR mistake, especially after paying $500 for a tint job.

But no, he just gave me this annoying stare and said “it will be taken care of ...” no apology, no other details , no hint of taking responsibility. He said it won’t take long.
I said how long, he said not long. I said I need to know approx time, he finally said 2-3 hours , lol. I said ok, I need to get back home.

So I now have to pay for Uber to go back home. I asked, “will you cover my Uber ride back home? it’s 15 min from here.”

He replied : “ we will replace the whole rear window tint for you...” this time, with a frown on his face.

I replied and told him I spent $25 on Uber when I brought the car to him the first time. Now, I have to spend an additional $25 on top of taking a day off work.

I said I think it’s fair you cover my Uber.

He frowned more and just said “I’ll take care of everything and walked off into the shop”

I stood there, wondering wtf just happened.

I thought about just taking my car and leaving...then I called an Uber and now I’m on the way home 


Very sour experience , not sure if I should’ve left my car with him, but oh well, sentry mode is ON lol

I asked my electrician buddy. He thinks you used to smaller wire. Not sure what was used? Mine is 00. Or very heavy. As in cannot bend it easily. Like thick as pen for each of 4 wires. It was very hard to bend inside the CB cox.
Or the Male to female connection is not very tight. Female part in receptacle must be very very tight, as in push hard to insert Male end of cord.
""

That's very unlikely that it was too small wire. It would have had problems long before that if it were the case. These kinds of issues are much more commonly a connection being bad in some way, which is usually one of two related types of things. Sometimes where the rubber insulation was stripped back, it wasn't quite stripped at the right distance or the wire was pushed in too far, so that part of the insulation got pinched in the terminals, so there wasn't a very solid connection to the wire. Or related to that, if the connection wasn't tightened up enough at the start, it could work its way loose over time with the cycles of heating and cooling causing the wire to expand and contract some. And then if the connection is loose, you have a very small connection point, which becomes highly resistive and is a hot spot.

I know you love talking about how you have 00 wire gauge, but that's really too big for a 14-50 outlet--as in it's impossible to fit into the terminals of almost any brand of 14-50 outlet, so you would generally not get a proper connection, and you're giving people bad advice. 6 gauge would be about the right size for a 50A circuit.",,0,0,0,0

Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) are commonly developed at a fixed resource budget, and then scaled up for better accuracy if more resources are available. In this paper, we sys- tematically study model scaling and identify that carefully balancing network depth, width, and res- olution can lead to better performance. Based on this observation, we propose a new scaling method that uniformly scales all dimensions of depth/width/resolution using a simple yet highly effective compound coefficient. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on scaling up MobileNets and ResNet.
To go even further, we use neural architecture search to design a new baseline network and scale it up to obtain a family of models, called EfficientNets, which achieve much better accu- racy and efficiency than previous ConvNets. In particular, our EfficientNet-B7 achieves state- of-the-art 84.4% top-1 / 97.1% top-5 accuracy on ImageNet, while being 8.4x smaller and 6.1x faster on inference than the best existing ConvNet. Our EfficientNets also transfer well and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on CIFAR-100 (91.7%), Flowers (98.8%), and 3 other transfer learning datasets, with an order of magnitude fewer parameters.

Fixed margin assumes they pulled out 4k of cost (via volume, part cost, or labor) along with the 5k of sales price. If they only drop the price, the margin % shifts also.
80k cost on 105k car = 24%
80k cost on 100k car = 20%
80k cost on 95k car = 16%

Yes - I'm assuming they are keeping that 20% margin. Used to be 25% in Q3/Q4.

The ASP could drop because of discounting pre-Raven cars (in this quarter) or because the mix of trims has shifted downwards. I'd expect them to keep a minimum of 20% margin, though. Obviously if they can't keep margin of 20%, there will be more of a hit to p&l.",,0,0,0,0

Tesla marks the map of the general area of the supercharger. Just because it’s showing Eberfield doesn’t mean it’ll actually be where the pin is dropped.

I still go back to my original comment of Indiana being known for using Meijer as supercharger locations. Every Meijer near an interstate or highway seems to get one in Indiana/Ohio - Zionsville, Carmel, Lafayette, Merilleville, Terre Haute, Fort Wayne, Dayton, etc . There’s a Meijer in Evansville right off the interstate, so I would assume that’s where it’ll end up.
""

Interpreting Tesla's lack of rigorousness in putting grey pins on exact locations as supporting the notion that the current Elberfeld pin could actually turn out to be a location in Evansville is kinda ridiculous. If a pin is on a different jurisdiction that far away from the actual location it would only be in the reverse situation--i.e. grey pin on the big city but actual build location 15 miles away in the little town whose name no one would recognize unless they were a local. Tesla may end up putting a supercharger in Evansville at some point in the future--I certainly hope they will. It could even be at that Meijer--though I would say that the Target on Lloyd Expressway is a better and more likely location (Tesla also partners with Target for supercharger locations)--but if/when they do, the grey pin will be on Evansville.",,0,0,0,0

“I am aware of this issue, it does not have anything to do with overheating of the processor, it is a firmware bug that is currently under investigation and has affected the majority of the fleet. Engineering is working to resolve this issue, currently it is listed as p1 or “critical” priority . This issue has been present since late last week and the amount of activity I have seen around it I would speculate that rectification, in the form of a new firmware release, is around the corner. The temporary work around would be letting the vehicle sleep, this will allow the DAS module to reset and it should resume normal activity on the next drive cycle, the issue will most likely reoccur though .Turning sentry mode off will allow the vehicle to sleep so this must be disabled in order for the module to reset. In general I would not rely on user forms for information of this type, misinformation runs quickly through these channels and often false information as well.“

One on each side at the rear (in place of a differential) and you're hauling whatever you want. Done.

Now, what are you doing to do with all that unused space under the hood, battery?
""

The problem with this approach is the gearing, or lack thereof. Having taken out the transmission and differential, you're left with the motor spinning at wheel speed - meaning something like 500 rpm on the freeway, with no torque multiplication.

You want at least 9:1 gearing, and ideally more like 15 or 20:1, to get the motor into useful operating range and get the torque up to something viable for pulling loads.

A stacked pair of planetary sets might be sufficient, but that's not generally an off the shelf option that I've seen.

The other obvious solution is to keep the differential and transmission and put the motor where the engine goes. There's some wasted weight in that, since you don't need all of the gearing options the transmission gives, but it can work.",,0,0,0,0

Easy to override? The problem with auto accidents is that they happen in a fraction of a second. Yes, that's not identical to the technical issues of the 737 MAX. The similarities are that the system is intended to improve the safety of operating the vehicles but have design flaws that I will simply say, greatly reduce the improvement of safety.

If Tesla didn't think this has issues, it wouldn't continually consider their software to be ""beta"".
""

Air accidents can happen in a fraction of a second as well, but the congestion is generally less in the airspace. All told, there are somewhere around 10,000 airplanes in the skies according to FlightFinder (carrying over 1.2 million passengers) at any given time globally. We have more vehicles than this on the roads in my city alone during rush-hour.

The 737-MAX issue has been well documented, and it is my understanding that there were compromises with flight-dynamics of the plane itself that contributed to the problems - in other words, this was not purely the fault of software implementation. In Boeing's case, the aircraft tended to pitch upwards because of the forward positioning of the engines (which were larger). They also made a fateful decision to exclude secondary sensory input in their standard build (offered for a mere 50K less on a plane which cost 100M).

I do believe there is much to learn from Boeing's mistakes, which boils down to five primary issues:

- Rapid push to get to market
- Cost reduction strategies and Build Selection errors (which should have made redundant sensors standard)
- Poor oversight and testing
- Lack of communication and training for pilots
- Use of Software to compensate for Hardware design flaws

Take from this what you may! I will also state that it is much easier for us to comment than it is for Tesla to implement. For such a small organization, it is pretty incredible that they've managed to create several of the safest vehicles on the roads.

I'm sure it's easy to get used to. I sat in a 3 in a show room multiple times (this was before they were giving test drives) and really wanted to make it work, as the 3 was the perfect size for me and the price was more in line with what I typically pay for cars. And early reviews from former MS owners said it was an easy transition. But in the end, it reminded me too much of the screens sticking up out of the dash of equivalent BMW, Audi, and MB ICE vehicles, which I always felt were tacked on as afterthoughts. I almost cried when they first revealed the dash on the 3 - ""oh no - they are copying the Germans but on overdrive!"" 

So yeah a lot of my reaction is just aesthetics. But your dash is the thing you spend all your time seeing while you drive.
""

You should not need to look at the dash. That is why a HUD is so important. On my BMW X3 the HUD has speed, traffic, navigation, etc. Your eyes stay outside the car so you never look down at the dash and look to a nasty surprise. I really wish my Model X had a HUD.",,1,0,0,0

I dropped the car off last Saturday (May 4) and will pick it up Saturday, May 11.

When I got my first email from Tesla where DA introduced herself, I reviewed my order detail and I noticed that the tax calculated was not Ontario HST but it was closer to Quebec taxation. So I asked about tax calculation, whether it would be better to pick it up in Toronto (to not mix the taxation), or whether they offer a home delivery. And she offered home delivery.

Then there was no movement on my account for nearly 6 weeks . When I later suggested that I am willing to travel to Toronto or Montreal to pick up the car just to received it faster, but my DA suggested me that it is less trouble for them to ship it to my home address.

When all the paperwork was calculated correctly and signed, it took them one day to arrange the delivery - it was very fast. The truck had 3 other model 3s. So I guess they ship the car as soon as they fill up the truck - and now they have enough demand to fill a truck up maybe 2 times a week easily (if they have enough cars).

I had the exact same experience. Tax calcs were wrong (not even in line with Qc taxes) so I called and the agent said the initial docs are generated in California and routinely off for Canadian deliveries, and they would be corrected when a DA is assigned and reviews the file.

3705372,EV Market Share,canoemore,2019-05-30 10:43:00,"canoemore said:
↑

The concept of frequency-dependent selection provides a useful extension of the evolution analogy. This is when the fitness of a phenotype increases as the frequency of that phenotype increases. This phenomenon is well documented in nature, particularly with traits that involve signalling, such as warning coloration.

Analogies to EVs (and other technologies) are pretty obvious, and boil down to the notion that as adoption becomes more widespread, the utility of a technology increases for one reason or another. For example, as the frequency of the EV ""phenotype"" increases, the network of charging stations to serve them increases in density, thereby increasing the ""fitness"" of EVs still further: ergo, positive frequency-dependent selection. You can see that the converse can also be true. ICE vehicles will eventually experience negative frequency-dependent selection: as they fall in frequency, filling stations will start to close, reducing their ""fitness"" (i.e. utility). These obviously aren't novel observations, and are discussed (sans evolutionary metaphor) at length in various threads here.

However, a return to the original comment about stealing market share from hybrids with this context may offer a more novel observation. At first glance, I don't see a reason why hybrids should experience similar positive density-dependent selection. As the frequency of hybrids goes up, what intrinsic feature of a hybrid, or what accompanying infrastructure, would increase their ""fitness""? They still fill up at gas stations, so contribute to positive frequency-dependent fitness of traditional ICE vehicles. I don't think the experience of owning a hybrid has appreciably changed since the first generation Prius, at least not as a result of the much higher frequency of hybrids in the market today. I suppose you could argue that larger market share has produced economies of scale that have driven down costs of hybrid components, but I'm not sure that really counts - hybrids still typically cost more than their ICE counterparts.

Meanwhile, as EV market share has grown, the ownership experience has gotten dramatically better, and the ""fitness"" of EVs has increased in step with their frequency. We see the results of this when members of this forum share anecdotes about how they've convinced friends and family who aren't ""early adopters"" to buy a Tesla.

Another interesting application of this evolutionary thinking would be to predict the fates of the morass of charging standards.
""

Slight correction to the above. Instead of negative frequency-dependent selection, I meant to say that positive frequency dependent selection cuts both ways, and the decrease in ICE frequency will produce a concurrent decrease in fitness. Negative frequency dependent selection describes the inverse relationship between fitness and phenotype frequency, i.e. the more common a phenotype becomes, its fitness decreases.",,0,0,0,0

I have a weird data point to add to Folder sorting in 2019.12.1.1:

I found that all of my folders of seventy minutes or less appear to sort correctly when I have put numbers in front of the track and file names (and even when I haven't adjusted the track and file names). However, my one file of three plus hours, with 37 tracks, does not sort correctly, nor can I see any pattern to the sorting order — it isn't alphabetical. This file sorted fine on 2018.50.6, so this is new. Since I don't know how it is sorting that long folder, I don't know how to fix it, although breaking it up into three folders might work.

Go figure.

this price action is so controlled and tight right now. is it consolidation?
or a head fake?

upside still has to be the higher probability. downside, with all the issues going on, still had some probability, no?

the thing bdy pointed out about it being different is the scary part. like as if, “ok, we belong here at 190...we’re staying here once we shake out those levered on the way here” type deal

if that is true, i could see a bounce 30-40 bucks and then trickling back here or worse.

if that (the stagnancy at 189-190) IS the head fake, then the unwinding of short leverage could put us back to where we’ve become used to being in the 300 range.

then again, if we get some really bad news, it can continue south.

this is a tricky one.

if i had gun to head i’d say 40% each on scenarios 1 and 2
and 20% on us just purely going lower than here.

i played a bounce up, but i’m in zelk’s camp.
i want to go bigger, but as of right now, i don’t quite have the stomach for it.
that being said i still have a pretty sizeable chunk on telsa at moment, for me anyway.

since may 15 my nuts are in my stomach, but ive been here before. so it doesn’t nearly affect me like it did when i was younger, (to zelks point #2)
""

You know that if the 3 of us are thinking about adding TSLA but hesitant due to the price action, this is undoubtedly what many TSLA longs/buyers are feeling right now. There are lots of buyers just waiting right now. Shorts are continuing to pressure the stock without much covering even after such a huge drop because buyers aren't forcing them to cover. That's what is missing so far compared with all prior big drops. 

Ultimately, what underlies this drop is market uncertainty over demand. Jonas used the delta in total deliveries between Q1 and Q4 2018 to make his point. Deliveries were down sequentially by 1/3. This can only be definitively refuted with increased deliveries. Unfortunately, one quarter of increased deliveries probably won't be enough to undue the damage, but it will help. Many analysts will likely ignore sequential increase in deliveries for Q2 vs Q1. That's just the way it is right now.

If we get good delivery numbers, how far will the stock climb? It will require significant volume to clear resistance levels above us, particularly the upper channel line, which may be perhaps around $230 at that point. That would be about a 25% climb from the $185 low so far, which is what I would expect based on historical stock movement. I think the upper limit would probably be the 50 MA, perhaps $245ish, depending upon when we get there. The upper bollinger band is way up at $268. I do not think that is likely on the first bounce, but you never know. The other question is, where do we find support after we get a pullback after the bounce. We need to get out of this trend and make a higher low. A lot of people will be looking to make a buck on the bounce, and there will be plenty of selling when it looks like the bounce is starting to get sold. Where will buyers step back in on that pullback?",,2,1,0,0

If you were all places on vwvortex ... you are selectively forgetting the VW 1.8T engines (circa 2000) fiasco with it's oil frothing, starvation of main bearings, and game over.. ? Triggered a class action.

This bit me. I got the low oil pressure light one day, 6 years in on a very well maintained and oil changed engine... and the bill would have been $5K to fix the car (new engine). Instead, I dumped the car on a used car lot, took cash in hand, and will never by another VW again... even if they are electric.

There you go, blown bearings, scored rotor (crankshaft), and host of other shot things due to an oiling design issue.

I had 2.8L 6 around that time frame, awesome engine. My favorite VW engine of all time. Not the stupid traverse mount narrow V6 Same engine that Audi A6 had at the time. I had so few issues with that car I didn't visit vwvortex all that often, sorry. I did have later 2.0T (with gummed up intakes). Other than that car good reliability.

6 years in Tesla world is a near eternity. Your VW was near worthless after 6 years even with a good engine, that's why you dumped it.

Hard to say. The lion's share of TS' generation flows to NM and Colorado, which have both upped their regulatory demands a LOT in the last few months and in a welcome change from past RPS legislation now include co-ops in the RPS. It may be that TS is trying to delay in order to push Guzman past the wind energy tax credit deadline (and thereby make them less competitive) but if TS is acting to form they are just:

1. stupid
2. reactionary Repukes

Will future Tesla cars be equipped with those ""pizza satellite dish"" (maybe hidden in the hood) to be used for internet connection instead of the SIM cards they are using now?
""

The technical answer is yes. There's no major roadblock with mounting the antenna on a car, and especially a Tesla. Really its a pretty trivial matter of finding volume under one of the horizontal-is surfaces, like the hood, roof, or trunk lid, and of course making that surface RF transparent. A road going (two dimensional) vehicle is in fact the most ideal mobile installation--the vibrations and bumps and stuff are insignificant relative to a constellation of orbiting satellites. That's one of the reasons SpaceX decided to test their antenna on an aircraft that sees significant angular motion relative to ""pointing up"", as that's pretty much the worst case for a mobile installation. 

The big issue is cost. Nobody knows what a Starlink terminal will cost and nobody knows what the Starlink service will cost, but it is most probable that--especially for the net 4-6 years--Starlink simply won't be affordable for most individual users.

Of course, the flip side to your suggestion that 'networking execs' be scared applies to SpaceX being scared of them.

Echter ik heb niet het gevoel dat de belijning het ingreep heeft beïnvloed maar eerder het feit dat ik dus, om de tegenligger ruimte te geven, vrij dichtbij de rand van de weg heb gereden.

Still wondering whether I have the same problem. The slight tapping/knocking from the front left only seems to happen as I accelerate or slow down, usually slower than 12mph or so. It’s very quiet - no one would notice it except me and maybe someone very attuned to Teslas, or listening for it. It’s quiet enough (and has not changed) that it makes me think it is mechanically something minor...

Just wondering if someone who has actually addressed this knows exactly what is wrong so I can just fix it myself - if it is actually as simple as tightening the axle nut or torquing a suspension bolt I’m inclined to do it myself. But obviously a half axle replacement I’d have to have the new part, so not an option... 

It is not clear to me why a “loose axle nut” would result in this behavior though. I could understand defective CV joints with too much play or something like that. Or suspension creaking/tapping due to a loose bolt.

If you charge to the same level on a regular basis you should be able to notice that instead of the usual 180 miles of range the car would only present you with 175 miles now (just a fictive example). That is, if Tesla really introduced some reduction of usable energy of course.

Can't apply that retroactively. So many mine fields on that model as well and Tesla has a hard enough time with basic details and lack of customer service... That and you'd have to have a mechanism that exempts actual travelers who need that actual full charge, you don't see gas stations charging extra to fully fill your tank...

The answer is simple, build a lot more stations and phase out the unlimited people like myself over time. If there were as many SCs as there are gas stations this would be a moot point entirely... Since we're not going to get anywhere remotely near that for a very long time, building as many as can be built as fast as they can be built is really the only option. Tesla is starved for cash right now, starved for a lot of things actually, and so I don't have much faith in the kind of expansion needed...

Funny how one of the things that might kill Tesla is their own popularity and not being able to scale enough to handle that... Had a coworker of mine lose their mind because they had to wait on a road trip to charge and it pissed their wife off enough that she forced him to get rid of the Tesla as soon as they got home... Extreme? Absolutely but I have a sneaking suspicion it's not as extreme as it sounds when you first hear it...

Jeff
""

I agree with @Rocky_H. I will just add that I thought they already increase the price of supercharging or at least changed it? So, charging more for 80-100% should not be a problem in doing so going forward? If you are talking about those that have free unlimited then that would be a problem to start charging at all. However, I will just speak for me personally. For them to limit me to 80% when I believe I need more then that is a major problem. Charging me for going over 80% would not compare to being limited even though I have free unlimited.",,1,0,0,0

Exclusive: Tesla woes send Panasonic's U.S. solar cells to Philippines

Reuters reported on May 15 that Panasonic planned to ship most cells from the plant overseas, instead of selling them to Tesla for its trademark Solar Roof as initially intended, because of low demand from Tesla and a trade loophole that had fired up new foreign interest. That loophole allows companies outside the United States to ship solar panels into America duty-free provided the panels are made with U.S.-built cells.
""

People getting recent quotes from Tesla for traditional rooftop solar systems have been quoted Hanwha Q-cell panels. I fail to see the logic in installing 3rd party solar panels when you have a captive supply of domestic panels available. The obvious answer is that the Hanwha panels plus tariff cost less than the complete Panasonic panels. Does it really make sense for a third party to buy the US made cells, export them to the Philippines, assemble them into panels and then re-import them back to the States, compared to just using the same Hanwha panels?",,0,0,0,0

You go a step further than me. I usually either pressure wash mine (rinse all the dirt off first, then use foam cannon, then rinse, then dry with microfiber cloth) or I just run it through a car wash. There's a decent touchless carwash near me that I use but I'm also not opposed to using a normal drive through car wash.

I know it's not perfect and I know I'm not going to have a flawless surface but I really don't care. Like I said - this isn't a show piece for me, it's a daily driver and a damn good one at that!

By the way - are you using the Tesla roof rack for hauling your bike or have you gone a different route? I'm trying to decide if I want to bother with a way to transport my road bike or not. We've got a family trip to the mountains this summer and there are some epic routes up there that I'd LOVE to take my bike on. But 95% of my riding is from my driveway so it's almost not worth it to me to invest in a bike rack for my M3. I can use my wife's GLS with my Thule if I really need to.
""

I could probably get one of those glorified windshield wiper things to get most of the car dry, and skip the carwash. The car wash filters their water so its pretty spotless and one or two microfibers I can get the remainder dry when I get home.
I'm pretty forgetful. Short of the car auto stopping at the garage door, there is no system that would keep me from running a bike on my roof into the garage. I went with the torkhitch method instead. Here is a picture of it at Sea Otter in Monterey. I was removing the hitch for a clean look at first but now I just leave it. It looks cool and throwing my bike rack on there only takes about 2 minutes. Its a pricey addition but worth it.

Inverter is not set to battery priority mode it setup as a battery backup. Contactors control L1 and L2 input to the inverter. (another set of contactors control battery input). It also integrated with my solar setup and I added consumption meter. 
Bypass happens on inverter side if battery gets disconnected inverter goes in bypass mode and connect everything to a grid ( It also helps to back feed my extra solar production to the utility).

Thanks for the reply. I plan to keep it for long time if we don't have any issues with the car. When I searched online, I see the seats with black cracks(like dots) on the side after 2 years of use in both black and white seats. I am seeing that already in my 2018 car as this was placed in a mall earlier. I am wondering that the same may happen to the new car seats too? Will check the option of going to LR. Last weekend, I went to an event which is 35 miles from my place and for the trip it used 100 miles of charging with the AC(Texas heat) and radio. This probes me to go to the LR too  I will update you. Also, I have a 100D inventory car with the price of 84k (white on white with 6 seat layout) added to the account and waiting for the photos. I feel, those seats also stained as it's an inventory car. But the price is tempting for me 
""

Yes, the prices on some inventory 100Ds are really good! That’s why i cancelled our refresh SR order and changed to inventory ones. Like you, we opted white seats, it just looks so much better, in my opinion. That 84k price is a steal for that configuration!✨

The fans ramp up but the louvers in the front grill don't open, creating the initial very loud fan noise. About 20 seconds in to the loud fan noise, the louvers finally open, allowing a rush of air through the louvers and fan, causing the whooshing noise, followed by subsequent reduction in fan sound.

Think of it like covering the nozzle on your vacuum cleaner while it's running, then slowly removing your hand. It makes a lot of noise while covered, whooshes, then calms down to the normal sound.

Tesla is currently saying the driver needs to be vigilant. Until they get to much higher level of accuracy, they won't tell drivers to sit back and relax.

From a liability POV, all this is still driver assistance feature.

Engineering is working to resolve this issue, currently it is listed as p1 or “critical” priority . This issue has been present since late last week and the amount of activity I have seen around it I would speculate that rectification, in the form of a new firmware release, is around the corner. The temporary work around would be letting the vehicle sleep, this will allow the DAS module to reset and it should resume normal activity on the next drive cycle, the issue will most likely reoccur though .Turning sentry mode off will allow the vehicle to sleep so this must be disabled in order for the module to reset.""",,0,0,0,0

No. It has never needed to make a profit but it has proven that it could discipline itself and made profits.

Last year, the shorts repeatedly told Tesla that there's no way it could survive without another funding round for 2018.

Elon Musk was so frustrated with them and said their questions were ""boring, bonehead questions.""

To disprove the skeptics, Tesla did not raise another funding round in 2018 but it achieved 2 profitable quarterly profits back-to-back.

I have an upcoming mobile service appointment. Will report back on experience. In the meantime feel free to watch Jesse from Now You Know's experience:

""

Well almost 2 months from when my process started with mobile tech, he showed today. He was super experienced, competent, and fixed even difficult things I did not think a mobile tech could do like aligning my falcon door. The result was good, but the process pretty bad due to poor communication and long wait. 

The mobile tech gave me 2 tips: 

1) Given my distance from the service center and mobile tech guy, I was always under the impression I should hold off calling service until I had 4 or more minor items or a large one. The mobile tech guy said it is better to contact service with 1 or 2 minor items as the mobile techs are supposed to try and complete everything in 2 hours or less. If they estimate it will take longer, it takes much longer to get into their schedule.
2) If at all possible do not add new items to your list unless they will need parts. Every time you add a new item to the list, the system puts you back to the back of the line.

Both these tips explain why it took so long for me to get mobile tech. If, however, I had been notified it would take a long time because of the number of items or told I just made my wait longer by adding a new item via text or any other form of communication, it would have been a much better experience. Communication to set expectations properly is what is most needed at this point to easily improve mobile service. Of course, more mobile techs wouldn't hurt either. As for my mobile tech, once he arrived at my house and did all the work in my driveway, I was very happy. Overall, I remain optimistic about the the long term future of Tesla service. i believe they have the right model, it might just take a couple more years of maturity to grow into it.",,0,0,0,0

I definitely would prefer to leave my LDA on, I think that vibrating the wheel is an excellent safety feature - and I'm even curious about the assist feature. But it's not worth the beeping, if they have added that somehow.

I have to question the logic behind Teslas’s handling of situations like this. A person buys a vehicle from them, thinks they are getting about $50 worth of free supercharging after spending $50K on one of their cars, only to find out that Tesla won’t honor the bonus because they did not fill out the link the correct way. So instead of making a new owner feel good about their purchase, they sour the person’s early impression of the company to save the company $50 worth of electricity.

Update:

After the pump running for long period of time and losing miles while plugged in during the last two weeks, which happened in two separate days after charging, I've not noticed any new occurrence. The only negative side effect is my Rated Miles are now being calculated down by about 10 miles (my battery has shrunk  ). My conclusion is that Tesla, post 2019.16.x updates, executed two separate maintenance routines to calibrate the HV battery on some cars (maybe the announced fire prevention update?). The routines had to run off of the HV battery and that's why the car never used the shore power and kept pulling power from the HVB resulting in a severe vampire drain while pumps were running for hours long.

3706345,Tesla Convertible bonds?,Boomer19,2019-05-30 15:26:00,"mrmage said:
↑

Someone gave you the wrong information on these, so I'm chiming in. Specifically, I'll use the Tesla 2024 convertibles as an example since this is what I bought. I'll also assume Tesla SP is $190 for the calculations. I'm new to corporate convertible bonds, but not totally new to convertible debt.
CUSIP 88160RAG6
Bonds Detail

The bond component of a convertible is like a normal bond, where it pays interest and pays back the face value at maturity. In the case of 88160RAG6, they're trading just below $90 for $100 face value and pay 2% a year. This means you get paid simple interest of $10 for 5 years plus $10 profit from trading below $100, which is $20 / $90 / 5 = 4.4%.

The bonds also have an option (but not required) to convert to Tesla shares at a minimum ratio of 3.22 per $1000 of bonds. The conversion price is therefore ~$310 a share or lower. You would only convert if the current SP is above the conversion price of course to net an immediate profit.

If Telsa SP is $500 in 2024, you'll make (500 - 310) = $190 / share = $59 / bond. Add the $20 from interest and discounted price today for a profit of $79 per bond, or 87% profit after 5 years.

Doing similar math for convertibles and summarizing 5 years out:
If Tesla SP is $10, profit is 22%
If Tesla SP is $95, profit is 22%
If Tesla SP is $190, profit is 22%
If Tesla SP is $310, profit is 22%
If Tesla SP is $500, profit is 87%
If Tesla SP is $1000, profit is 260%
If Tesla SP is $4000, profit is 1294%

Compare this to to buying shares.
If Tesla SP is $10, profit is -95%
If Tesla SP is $95, profit is -50%
If Tesla SP is $190, profit is 0%
If Tesla SP is $310, profit is 63%
If Tesla SP is $4000, profit is 2000%

I look at it this way, but this is solely my opinion.

1. I'm buying Tesla because it may go up 5x or 10x. If it only goes up 10% annually, I might as well invest in bonds or more conservative stocks. The convertibles ensure a profit except in the most unlikely case (bankruptcy AND assets can't cover debt). Even so, I should get a good chunk back in the worst case.

2. Although convertibles with TSLA SP $4000 nets 1/3 less than buying stock outright, the additional security and profit lets me invest more than double what I would with stocks. In the big win scenario, I'm ahead. And in the lose scenario, I'm ahead.

Some other pluses for convertibles:
1. There's cases where the conversion ratio increases (share price is cheaper) if Tesla has a change of control (bought out) for around $250 and higher. This adds extra profit in the event things don't work out.
2. Conversion is possible anytime if SP stays above ~30% + conversion price for awhile.
3. Bond holders may even come out whole or mostly whole in the event of bankruptcy, assuming Tesla assets are worth a decent amount.
4. Convertible bonds can be sold and bought like stocks, but goes down about half the rate of TSLA stock when it falls.

Disadvantages:
1. The spread for convertibles ranges from 1-4 points, so it's much higher than stocks, but generally better than options.

So at best 247-248 on a 100%. This car is from 2015, and has 41,000 miles. Considering it should have been about 270 miles to begin with, this represents just shy of 10% degradation on this, which is I think quite a bit more than average.

I'd heard earlier 90kWh packs had many problems of which rapid degradation was one. Maybe this is that?

I'd love to hear what you guys think of this - should I take delivery, or roll the dice on another P90DL, or get a P85D instead (apparently way better battery packs). I don't take trips all that often to need a huge battery but I also don't want to spend $60,000 on a car and get a badly degraded one.

You hit it on the head. Now go post it into the investor forum where they live in a bubble and can't possibly comprehend how Tesla's poor QC (they also fired their QC team ""didn't need em"") affects perception of their premium priced product.

I have had literally dozens of people ask me how I like my Tesla and I tell all of them the same thing. Nothing drives as well as a Tesla Model 3 anywhere near its price range but virtually any car in the same price range (BMW, Merc, Audi) will have higher assembly quality, better paint, fewer defects and a far more competent staff by way of a massive dealer network for correcting the service issues that do show up.

100% down to your charging solution.
If the car is plugged into the generic cheaply installed 15amp circuit possibly shared with other units then there is some chance of fire if the car over taxes the circuit.

If the charging circuit is dedicated and properly installed the chance of a random fire is going to be roughly the same as an ICE sitting in a garage for months.

I know some of the unhinged sycophants will be offended by that but a rational thinker will realize that of the cases of unattended ICE catching fire in garages most are electrical fires in the 12volt system. BMW has had this problem, some 90s GM full-size cars did too, or rodents chew wires. Well your Tesla has a 12volt system too.

I have my carport directly connected to my living room, and the wall connector is installed under that carport.
Whenever I'm charging at home, The car seems to restart charging a bit every hour to top off the battery. I thought it would just do that every day or so. It only stops doing that when I use the app to ""stop charging"".

This behavior is annoying because of 2 reasons:
1: teslafi generates a ton of charge entries. And since I use that to have my business pay back my charging costs to myself, that's kind of annoying.
2: the starting and stopping of the wall connector makes the heavy relay in the WC click, and apparently that's enough to drive my dog berserk.

Is this normal behavior?

I'm on 2019.8.4 at the moment
""

Yes, I have seen this behavior. It started with some update like a couple of months ago (I may have even posted about it at the time). I can't hear my Wall Connector from inside my house, but I do have a Sense Energy Monitor and I can see when it happens.

It is pretty hit or miss though and I have not been able to isolate why it happens. It may be every hour for several hours after I get home and initially recharge my car, but then it stops and does not start again until I come home the next day and plug in. Some days I don't think it does it at all.

I have not been able to correlate it to outside temperature or my presence near the car (waking it up, etc...), but it is highly likely that one of these things might be a factor to whether it does it or not?

I am unsure if this is intended behavior by Tesla (to keep the battery more topped up to the level you set it to), or whether it is a bug/defect.

I do like that my car is closer to the set charge point when I come out in the morning, but I dislike the extra cycles put on the wall connector contactor and charging system in general.",,0,0,0,0

Does it really make sense for a third party to buy the US made cells, export them to the Philippines, assemble them into panels and then re-import them back to the States, compared to just using the same Hanwha panels?

↑

Someone gave you the wrong information on these, so I'm chiming in. Specifically, I'll use the Tesla 2024 convertibles as an example since this is what I bought. I'll also assume Tesla SP is $190 for the calculations. I'm new to corporate convertible bonds, but not totally new to convertible debt.
CUSIP 88160RAG6
Bonds Detail

The bond component of a convertible is like a normal bond, where it pays interest and pays back the face value at maturity. In the case of 88160RAG6, they're trading just below $90 for $100 face value and pay 2% a year. This means you get paid simple interest of $10 for 5 years plus $10 profit from trading below $100, which is $20 / $90 / 5 = 4.4%.

The bonds also have an option (but not required) to convert to Tesla shares at a minimum ratio of 3.22 per $1000 of bonds. The conversion price is therefore ~$310 a share or lower. You would only convert if the current SP is above the conversion price of course to net an immediate profit.

If Telsa SP is $500 in 2024, you'll make (500 - 310) = $190 / share = $59 / bond. Add the $20 from interest and discounted price today for a profit of $79 per bond, or 87% profit after 5 years.

Doing similar math for convertibles and summarizing 5 years out:
If Tesla SP is $10, profit is 22%
If Tesla SP is $95, profit is 22%
If Tesla SP is $190, profit is 22%
If Tesla SP is $310, profit is 22%
If Tesla SP is $500, profit is 87%
If Tesla SP is $1000, profit is 260%
If Tesla SP is $4000, profit is 1294%

Compare this to to buying shares.
If Tesla SP is $10, profit is -95%
If Tesla SP is $95, profit is -50%
If Tesla SP is $190, profit is 0%
If Tesla SP is $310, profit is 63%
If Tesla SP is $4000, profit is 2000%

I look at it this way, but this is solely my opinion.

1. I'm buying Tesla because it may go up 5x or 10x. If it only goes up 10% annually, I might as well invest in bonds or more conservative stocks. The convertibles ensure a profit except in the most unlikely case (bankruptcy AND assets can't cover debt). Even so, I should get a good chunk back in the worst case.

2. Although convertibles with TSLA SP $4000 nets 1/3 less than buying stock outright, the additional security and profit lets me invest more than double what I would with stocks. In the big win scenario, I'm ahead. And in the lose scenario, I'm ahead.

Some other pluses for convertibles:
1. There's cases where the conversion ratio increases (share price is cheaper) if Tesla has a change of control (bought out) for around $250 and higher. This adds extra profit in the event things don't work out.
2. Conversion is possible anytime if SP stays above ~30% + conversion price for awhile.
3. Bond holders may even come out whole or mostly whole in the event of bankruptcy, assuming Tesla assets are worth a decent amount.
4. Convertible bonds can be sold and bought like stocks, but goes down about half the rate of TSLA stock when it falls.

Disadvantages:
1. The spread for convertibles ranges from 1-4 points, so it's much higher than stocks, but generally better than options.

So at best 247-248 on a 100%. This car is from 2015, and has 41,000 miles. Considering it should have been about 270 miles to begin with, this represents just shy of 10% degradation on this, which is I think quite a bit more than average.

The drop is accurately around 1"", a bit more in the rear but I'm not measuring a full 1.4"" based on pre/post images posted by another member on Page 2. If you haven't seen those, I'd go to Page 2 and see those actual before/after. Ultimately, I think it's just the design of the car that proves challenging here. I've lowered a lot of cars, typically a 1"" drop isn't very much. What I think is the case is the Tesla is actually already quite low, it just doesn't appear low because it's got a ridiculous and poorly designed 5-finger fender gap. Typically cars that are sporty are aesthetically designed to look low. So the case here is that to close the fender gap, the car must be very low. Additionally, there is this black trim on the side of the car below the painted area. It's not obviously visible to the naked eye unless you're looking for it. These black pieces, particularly in front of the rear wheels are actually quite large and go quite low, like multiple inches. You can see below some really good shots, the black trim is less than 4"" off the ground. That's VERY low, the good news is, it's an unusually large piece of plastic and it's not painted so it'll fare well with damage. For reference, a Corvette Z06 has 5.6"" of ground clearance in the front nose and 4.75"" under the car behind the front wheel. Given how close this piece is to the wheel, it's not as big of a deal however, and the battery packs and floor board are notably higher. In stock form, this piece is still VERY low, provably less than 5"", you'd never guess looking at the car, but there is this randomly unnecessary black trim piece that unnecessarily lowers the lowest point of the car. I believe this will be the piece that you'll notice rubbing particularly on off camber driveway.

As stated, it's just an unusual design with these skirts, but they serve as a good reminder and precaution to floor damage. Even without lowering, these pieces are quite low, but the proximity to the axle really helps. In reality, Tesla should have just made lower fenders, they missed a major performance aesthetic in their design.

Pics again, you can see how low this black piece is compared to where the red paint is.

View attachment 413749

Here again you can see how aggressive of a tail this has. This entire piece is a good 1"", maybe more lower than anywhere else on the car.

Thanks for the pics. I see exactly what you're talking about now. I didn't think those black trim pieces were that thick. I just hope they hold up well in the long term since I anticipate a lot of scraping. I'm seriously reconsidering the carbon fiber front lip now. It's supposedly only 0.5"" lower than the factory front but on top of the 1"" drop I'm planning to do with the coilovers, it might be a bad idea. I've had lowered cars in the past and it's always a hassle with slopes or having to go slowly over speed bumps in shopping plazas or parking structures when there's a bunch of cars behind you. I didn't mind it so much when I was younger but now I don't know...

Sadly, with Elon's latest self-created cashflow crisis, it might take an actual class action lawsuit to make them do the right thing, and even then they might just settle and therefore not admit liability, forcing consumers in each country to have to independently file their own class action (like they did with P85D horsepower complete over-specs, in Europe they settled, nothing for US customers). The second downside is that in class action lawsuits, the consumer doesn't get much, for example in FSD lawsuit people got $300 out of the $8,000 they paid - lawyers take the biggest chunk out of the settlement, so for this, after couple of years of litigation, customers with yellow screens might get $50 in compensation. That is still not ""doing the right thing"".

Unless of course Tesla does in fact get a full fleet of robotaxis on the roads next year, making money hand over fist, then sure, they'll start replacing screens again on their own accord.

In the case of 88160RAG6, they're trading just below $90 for $100 face value and pay 2% a year. This means you get paid simple interest of $10 for 5 years plus $10 profit from trading below $100, which is $20 / $90 / 5 = 4.4%.

The bonds also have an option (but not required) to convert to Tesla shares at a minimum ratio of 3.22 per $1000 of bonds. The conversion price is therefore ~$310 a share or lower. You would only convert if the current SP is above the conversion price of course to net an immediate profit.

If Telsa SP is $500 in 2024, you'll make (500 - 310) = $190 / share = $59 / bond. Add the $20 from interest and discounted price today for a profit of $79 per bond, or 87% profit after 5 years.

Doing similar math for convertibles and summarizing 5 years out:
If Tesla SP is $10, profit is 22%
If Tesla SP is $95, profit is 22%
If Tesla SP is $190, profit is 22%
If Tesla SP is $310, profit is 22%
If Tesla SP is $500, profit is 87%
If Tesla SP is $1000, profit is 260%
If Tesla SP is $4000, profit is 1294%

Compare this to to buying shares.
If Tesla SP is $10, profit is -95%
If Tesla SP is $95, profit is -50%
If Tesla SP is $190, profit is 0%
If Tesla SP is $310, profit is 63%
If Tesla SP is $4000, profit is 2000%

I look at it this way, but this is solely my opinion.

1. I'm buying Tesla because it may go up 5x or 10x. If it only goes up 10% annually, I might as well invest in bonds or more conservative stocks. The convertibles ensure a profit except in the most unlikely case (bankruptcy AND assets can't cover debt). Even so, I should get a good chunk back in the worst case.

2. Although convertibles with TSLA SP $4000 nets 1/3 less than buying stock outright, the additional security and profit lets me invest more than double what I would with stocks. In the big win scenario, I'm ahead. And in the lose scenario, I'm ahead.

Some other pluses for convertibles:
1. There's cases where the conversion ratio increases (share price is cheaper) if Tesla has a change of control (bought out) for around $250 and higher. This adds extra profit in the event things don't work out.
2. Conversion is possible anytime if SP stays above ~30% + conversion price for awhile.
3. Bond holders may even come out whole or mostly whole in the event of bankruptcy, assuming Tesla assets are worth a decent amount.
4. Convertible bonds can be sold and bought like stocks, but goes down about half the rate of TSLA stock when it falls.

Disadvantages:
1. The spread for convertibles ranges from 1-4 points, so it's much higher than stocks, but generally better than options.

My cruise control quit working earlier this week. Turning off Sentry Mode fixed issue for me.

The following is an email I received today from my Tesla service representative:

""I am aware of this issue, it does not have anything to do with overheating of the processor, it is a firmware bug that is currently under investigation and has affected the majority of the fleet. Engineering is working to resolve this issue, currently it is listed as p1 or “critical” priority . This issue has been present since late last week and the amount of activity I have seen around it I would speculate that rectification, in the form of a new firmware release, is around the corner. The temporary work around would be letting the vehicle sleep, this will allow the DAS module to reset and it should resume normal activity on the next drive cycle, the issue will most likely reoccur though .Turning sentry mode off will allow the vehicle to sleep so this must be disabled in order for the module to reset.""

Thanks for the pics. I see exactly what you're talking about now. I didn't think those black trim pieces were that thick. I just hope they hold up well in the long term since I anticipate a lot of scraping. I'm seriously reconsidering the carbon fiber front lip now. It's supposedly only 0.5"" lower than the factory front but on top of the 1"" drop I'm planning to do with the coilovers, it might be a bad idea. I've had lowered cars in the past and it's always a hassle with slopes or having to go slowly over speed bumps in shopping plazas or parking structures when there's a bunch of cars behind you. I didn't mind it so much when I was younger but now I don't know...

I agree about the ridiculously large fender gaps of the car. Not sure what they were thinking to be honest. Also, for some strange reason your car looks lower compared to others with the same drop. Might just be the angle of the pics though. Have you tested it on any steep driveways?
""

I think it’s partially the color and just darker look. If you look at the other ones from the shop, they’re also quite low. 

I think even with the lip, as long as it doesn’t stick out forward much more, it probably won’t be a big deal. I think the area I’ve highlighted will be the first area to provide issue even with an extra .5” on the front. 

I took one weird driveway. Basically it goes from flat, then sharply down and to the right. It makes a 90 degree right hand sweeper in 15-20’. So you’re already turning the front wheel before your rear wheels hit the downhill part. It’s fairly steep and in that case I heard a light scratch from the area I’ve highlighted. I imagine if I go slower it’d be a non-issue. It’s super narrow so you have to take it straight on. My actual driveway is moderately steep and i can enter/exit it straight on. My ATS-V front would just touch if I didn’t work an angle. 

I think the issues will be weird cambered driveways that have steep initial or finishing angles, not worried about speed bumps or driveways unless the driveway is super steep. It’s basically like driving a sports car. Corvette, Cayman, etc. but it’s not ridiculous like a Lambo.",,0,0,0,0

I think we're going to have to wait until the morning of Tuesday 4 June for the config to open.
Having had business dealings with US companies on the West Coast, my reasoning is:
The config can't open until after the SUTI date of Sat 1 June.
The config page and decision to go live is driven from the factory in Fremont, California.(i can't see such a global site having any Australian input)
California is 16 hours behind us, so assuming office hours of 0800-1600, the config page goes live overnight on Monday night or, more likely, during the sweet spot on our Tuesday morning 0800-1000 when it's 1500-1700 Monday afternoon over there.

What do you think of adding a ""Verified"" tag? Probably just a comment in the ""Leader"" column, since there is room there and it is a comment column only.

To achieve the ""Verified"" tag the participant would need to have documentation of each visit - photo, TeslaFi, tracker, or something else. I suggest giving the tag to anyone who agrees to keep documentation going forward, since it is a new rule.

I have not kept documentation, though I do sometimes take photos. It really would not be that hard to snap a phone photo at each supercharger, or get a tracker. I don't think missing a couple in your tracker would disqualify the visits or the ""verified"" tag - like if TeslaFi did not record it for some reason, or you forgot to take a photo.
""

The buzzkill accountant weighs in:

I am not in favor of a verified tag. I know how to snap a picture, but the rest is beyond me. It does not occur to me to snap a picture unless there is something really unusual about the charging session (like when I charged recently at Cheyenne, and I had to plow through the snow into the parking slot.) If we are already on the honor system with this challenge, adding verification just makes it more onerous and tedious.

Then we have to upload pictures--I upload so few pictures--that a brief written narrative to claim new visits (a five or ten minute exercise at the keyboard) transforms into gosh knows how long in trying to match what picture goes with what location, and then figuring out how to upload the pictures from my phone or digital camera.

Elon has been very clear hitting the delivery record this quarter is hugely important. Is anyone waiting until later in June to order given there will no doubt be incentives announced? My Mother in Law will be ordering one and I’ve advised her to wait a couple weeks. We’re near the factory so last minute delivery is not an issue.

Considering there doesn't seem to be a demand issue, and the only certainty is that you'll lose $1875 by taking delivery on July 1, I just don't see the benefit.

We found Sentry mode disabled overheat protection - and have turned Sentry mode off in our S & X.

This is likely due to how overheat protection is triggered - and because the onboard electronics stay active with Sentry active, the overheat protection isn't being triggered. This is likely an oversight - and should be easily fixable in an upcoming release.

Overheat protection prevents the interior from getting too hot. Evidently the large displays are not ""auto""-rated which has caused bubbles and yellow banding with the touchscreen adhesive. With overheat protection, the temperature stays no higher than 105 degrees, which should be cool enough to protect the touchscreens. Plus it should also help with other materials which degrade faster if exposed to extended periods of extreme heat inside a vehicle (like drying out of the seat materials).

It is not the latch to fold the rear seats down as I have already put foam in place (learned that one early). Just checking to see if anyone else has any ideas of places to check. It's hard since I am usually driving so I can't go in the back seat and check. It definitely sounds metallic and it definitely sounds internal, not external.

My the other Model 3 that has been returned was making rattle sound from the rear, too.
It was coming from one of the trunk lid hinges where the adjusting bolt touch.

Road noise seem reduced as well but I did not have a decibel meter with me. It may be just enough to pull the trigger on a Raven, just need to find a buyer for my perfect P90D.

THE important question: in Sport mode (or sportiest mode, whatever the name) is the suspension height HIHER or LOWER than in Comfort mode? Or unchanged?

Interesting, I was messing with my hinges too, if you loosen the hinge bolt at the lid, you can adjust your panel alignment. It might also fix the rubbing issue on the hinge but I'm not sure. I don't think mine is rubbing there.

Maybe an easier fix would be adjust the stopper knobs to prevent the hinge from rubbing on that bolt?

I think it’s partially the color and just darker look. If you look at the other ones from the shop, they’re also quite low.

I think even with the lip, as long as it doesn’t stick out forward much more, it probably won’t be a big deal. I think the area I’ve highlighted will be the first area to provide issue even with an extra .5” on the front.

I took one weird driveway. Basically it goes from flat, then sharply down and to the right. It makes a 90 degree right hand sweeper in 15-20’. So you’re already turning the front wheel before your rear wheels hit the downhill part. It’s fairly steep and in that case I heard a light scratch from the area I’ve highlighted. I imagine if I go slower it’d be a non-issue. It’s super narrow so you have to take it straight on. My actual driveway is moderately steep and i can enter/exit it straight on. My ATS-V front would just touch if I didn’t work an angle.

I think the issues will be weird cambered driveways that have steep initial or finishing angles, not worried about speed bumps or driveways unless the driveway is super steep. It’s basically like driving a sports car. Corvette, Cayman, etc. but it’s not ridiculous like a Lambo.
""

Here's a pic of the lip I'm getting. It doesn't look too drastic of change from stock:  


My main concern has to do with my gf driving the car. Fortunately she doesn't drive it much. I've had some bad experiences in the past with low cars. Not with me driving but when others are driving my car. I had a C6 Corvette that was not lowered and my gf cracked the front end exiting a driveway. I had a lowered 300C SRT8 that my cousin was driving that ended up with the front bumper half ripped off. So yea I'm a bit paranoid now lol. It's been a while (10+ years) since I've driven a lowered car. If it's too much of a hassle I might just leave it stock height. But then I would have to put up with those hideous fender gaps. Ugh.

Just to clarify, those measurements you did were all post-spring installation, correct? It does give me hope that you said you can enter your driveway straight on. Do you have a pic of the driveway? I also have a decently steep driveway at my place. Can you take most speed bumps straight on?

""Model X automatically shifts into Park whenever you connect a charge cable or if two or more of the following conditions are met simultaneously:
•The driver's seat belt is unbuckled.
•The occupancy sensor in the driver's seat does not detect an occupant.
•The driver's door is opened.
Note: The above conditions do not reflect a comprehensive list of reasons why Model X may automatically shift into Park and, in certain scenarios, it is possible for your vehicle to shift into Park when only one of the above conditions is true.""

So, if the car behaves as intended, it seems unlikely a two-year-old would be able put the vehicle in drive; the following two things would have also had to happen:

1) Something heavy enough to overcome the weight requirement would have to be on the driver's seat. (This assumes a two-year-old is not heavy enough to meet the weight requirement, which I think is likely.)
2) The seat belt would have to be buckled (presumably by the child).

Not saying the described events did not happen, it is just that something must not have been working as intended, or something other than what has been speculated above (child pressed brake and pulled down on the stalk) must have occurred. Or, the Tesla weight occupancy sensor isn't using the weight to detect presence of the driver (for the driver's seat, it's possible that it is simply detecting something lightweight is in the seat and then allows driving). (Which would be a bug, since it has the capability to assess weight - that's how the car decides whether to turn on the passenger airbag or not - it seems to require greater than 75 pounds based on a recent post here asking about it - but it is true I do not know the exact weight requirement and presumably it depends on how it is distributed.)

Now for a thoughtful reply.

100% down to your charging solution.
If the car is plugged into the generic cheaply installed 15amp circuit possibly shared with other units then there is some chance of fire if the car over taxes the circuit.

If the charging circuit is dedicated and properly installed the chance of a random fire is going to be roughly the same as an ICE sitting in a garage for months.

I know some of the unhinged sycophants will be offended by that but a rational thinker will realize that of the cases of unattended ICE catching fire in garages most are electrical fires in the 12volt system. BMW has had this problem, some 90s GM full-size cars did too, or rodents chew wires. Well your Tesla has a 12volt system too.

Now the long list of you that want to attack me for the post please post a list of cases of fuel tanks of parked in garages ICE vehicles being the source of fires, again the SOURCE the presence of fuel being the source, not an aggravating factor.

CNN ‘front-runner’ poll showing Biden in lead didn’t sample significantly from 18- to 49-year-olds
""

There is a vast split between the younger generations and older generations in this country. I try to take into account that older generations always think the young are the end of everything and we've managed to muddle through, but this time there may actually be a very deep generational rift, at least in politics..

I heard an interview many years ago with an author who had written a book on generational attitudes and he pointed out that each generation tries to fix what they perceive their parents and grandparents got wrong. For a Boomer or GenX liking their parent's or grand parent's music would be considered weird, but it's very common among The Millennials and younger because swing music is generally not considered as good as rock and it's variations. The younger generations don't have any issues with their parent's music. Where they have problems is with the lack of community among GenX and Boomers as well as the early GenX political views which locked in during the Reagan era.

But all that said, the over 40s are far more reliable voters. Getting the under 40s involved is a great idea, but it could lead to frustration while you can pretty much guarantee that a high percentage of the over 40s will vote. If they hate your candidate, you could be in trouble unless you can pull off a unicorn election and get a massive turn out of the under 40s.

Dems tried choosing the nominee who ""would"" win last time...
""

The Dems last time treated the nomination process as more of a coronation than a real process to pick the best candidate. A lot of other qualified Dems sat out that process figuring that Hillary was going to be the nominee and with the changing demographics, would easily win the election. It was the same dynamic of the rabbit and the tortoise. Hillary was massively qualified vs a newby reality TV star aiming at a shrinking demographic.

Since the 1980s the white share of each presidential election has declined by 2% (0.5% per year average). Common wisdom said that the 2012 election was the last time a Republican candidate would have a shot at winning with a predominantly white targeted candidacy. That's one reason why a lot of non-white Republicans jumped into the 2016 fray. They thought it might be their year.

Between Trump getting some whites who had given up voting to come out, the low popularity of Hillary, and other factors like Russian interference, Trump managed to pull off an improbable win.

What makes you so certain the other candidates would lose to Trump? Only a little over 1/3 of registered voters voted for Trump. I imagine that some of those won't be voting for him again. Do we really need a candidate that appeals to the establishment to win? Or do we simply need a candidate that appeals to human decency (universal healthcare, fighting climate change, removing corporate influence in politics, etc)?
""

What we need is a candidate who will appeal to the center and the right of center disgusted with Trump. I watch the match up polls between Trump and other Democratic candidates, especially in states Trump absolutely needs to win. Biden polls the best in those states. In some of the more liberal states Biden still wins, but other Democrats do well too. But just winning the blue states is not enough. Biden could take some red states away from the Republicans like Texas and Arizona.

A big win would give the Democrats the political capital they need to start fixing things.

My philosophy is to not let the perfect become the enemy of the good and I see that happening among many on the left these days. There are a lot of progressives who want massive, sweeping improvements to everything. The middle of the electorate just want the madness to end. A massive swing the other way too quickly will traumatize them too much and who knows how they will vote. 

Rick Wilson who was a Republican strategist for many years has made the argument that Kamala Harris would win 7 states. I think he's exaggerating, but she would have difficulty breaking out of the guaranteed blue state pocket. Inslee is my governor, but I think his running for president is a mistake. He's polling near 0% and he's likely going to stay there. 

Having ideas that go beyond dealing with the political mess created by Trump is very important, but making your campaign all about an issue that ranks down the list for many voters is a losing strategy. According to Gallup polling, the two biggest issues are Government/Poor Leaderhip and Immigration:
Most Important Problem

I think it's far fetched to imagine many who supported Sanders (for whatever reason) turned around and voted for Trump instead of Clinton.
Doubtless there were some who in disgust just didn't vote. Now that the country has seen what Trump really is and what he has done, in 2020, left leaning progressives will absolutely hold their noses and vote for anyone the Dems run against Trump. They do need to run a candidate who can effectively counter Trump attacks, lies and distractions. Hiring Justin Amash for some mentoring in that department would be money well spent.
""

There are a fair number of Republicans and right leaning independents who will be willing to vote for a Democrat for the first time, but they want someone they consider ""safe"". IMO that's why Biden is polling so well in some red states. 

Ultimately the terrifying thing is that nobody knows for sure what the best strategy for turfing out Trump really is. I go with what hard data is available (polling), but it's incomplete and it's too early to make definitive calls based on polls alone.

I personally like some of the other Democrats over Biden. While my father could out hike me at 80 and he's still plugging along at 99 (though a bad knee ended his hiking days many years ago), Biden and Trump are both in the age range where someone could seem completely healthy one day and have a serious health crisis the next. I've seen a number of my parent's contemporaries quite active one day and either dead or in seriously poor health a few weeks later.

Because of this, there is a better than average chance Trump may not be the Republican candidate in 2020. Overall I think Biden's health is better. He takes care of himself better than Trump.

The US has the different party systems that switch every 30-50 years and the US is ripe for another one. At the end of a party system cycle there is a sense the old ideas are stale and not working anymore and people are ripe for something new, a new direction. That's happening in the US. The midterm elections were not only a rebuke of Trump, but also a sign of that thirst for change.

If the trend continues, the next Congress will likely be more progressive than this one. Biden is a moderate, but he will likely go along with a Congress that's more liberal than what he's used to. His political career started during the unraveling of the New Deal party system and the bulk of it was during the conservative Reagan party system. He had to adopt to more conservative ideals because that's the way the political winds were blowing. But he also has evolved with the time. He embraced same sex marriage quite quickly and he says he now regrets some of his more conservative moves in the past.

But the terrifying thing is nobody knows what will happen in 2020 and what the best combination is for the best possible outcome. The US would be in a very bad situation with 4 more years of Republican rule (even if it was president Pence). It's terrifying to try and map out the best possible strategy when the stakes are sky high and there are a lot of variables that are guess work and others completely out of your control.",,0,0,0,0

3706560,Brakes did not engage!,wk057,2019-05-30 16:52:00,"Tesla's not likely to provide much, if any info, without some legal order to do so.

Briefly, I'll just note as other's have that these phrases don't go together: ""not high speed"" and ""ALL of the airbags deployed"".

First, by ""all"" of the airbags, to me that is the driver steering wheel, driver knee, passenger knee, passenger top, driver seat, passenger seat, driver curtain, passenger curtain. To do all of the airbags, the crash would have to be pretty severe. As in, high speed with both high lateral and longitudinal components in the impact vector. That's not consistent with an accident that was ""not high speed"".

A light bump to the front of the car, even at creep speeds of 5-10 MPH, you're not likely to get any airbag deployment at all.

The braking system on the Tesla is the same hydraulic brake system used in virtually every vehicle on the road. The booster is electro-mechanical and not vacuum, but that's the only difference really. The pedal itself still has a direct physical link to the master cylinder, so even if the booster fails, the brakes still work (with additional effort required for hard stops).

Tesla also has transducers on the hydraulic lines as well to detect brake system pressure. Anything close to a physical failure (like, someone cutting the brake lines) is noticed immediately.

So....... back to pedal misapplication. It's really the only explanation here.



Garrett0606 said:
↑

I had something similar happen to me while pulling out of a parking spot. I pulled out ( had backed in to the spot) and got going about 10 mph and tried to press the brake but it was almost like the break pedal was stuck. I know it wasnt the gas pedal since i wasnt accelerating so i had to pull over and coast till i could just put the car into park. ( all still in the parking lot). I got out of the car checked the pedal to make sure there was nothing blocking it. And then checked all the breaks. When i got back in the car and tried again everything was normal.
""

This sounds kind of strange. The closest thing to this that's actually possible is the brake booster failing to energize, which wouldn't stop the brakes from working, but would make using them slightly more difficult. There is nothing on the car that can make the brake pedal stay stuck up. The opposite is true, as the car can *apply* the brake and force it to stay engaged using the iBooster... but return/release is basic mechanical/hydraulic/spring, not electronic.

BTW, this phenomenon isnt new in California just like the “Opioid Crisis” isnt new. It’s just that now it’s affecting a certain Demographic........ so now it’s a “crisis”
""

You are correct:

""The underlying premise of Proposition 47 was to free up funds so the state could focus on violent and serious offenders. Savings would be diverted to school-based prevention and support programs, victim services, and mental-health and drug treatment. Therefore petty thieves, who might be drug addicts, would avoid costly and ultimately detrimental incarceration. The referendum had the support of California Democratic party and the American Civil Liberties Union, and the state’s voters passed it into law in 2014.

What could possibly go wrong?

That question is best asked of the people in California who are robbed and call the police for help. Overall, they’re blindsided by the slow (or non-) response. The surprise and anger they feel is tremendous. Nearly a thousand dollars in stolen property is hardly minor, especially to those who have little to lose. It’s not just the loss of personal possessions they’ll probably never see again that is so distressing, but the ruined trust in the system that they assumed was designed to protect the innocent.

There has been a grassroots reaction to weakened laws, however. People are beginning to assume control. They’re not waiting for an authority figure to make everything alright. They’ve been hit by thieves too many times, and are tired of seeing their neighborhoods crumble under the weight of open drug use and commerce. Many have stopped believing that city leaders will ever come to their rescue. A type of vigilantism is emerging.""

I was a bit skeptical of the single screen idea at first. But I'm warming to it. If you think about it, driver's consoles are holdovers from the days when you needed a lot of information as a driver. The engines and systems were complex, unreliable and you needed to know what was happening before it led to a seized engine or something similar.

On an EV, what do you really need to know right now? Speed, arguably remaining range but nothing much else. Yes you want nav, audio, vehicle settings, fault information and such - but it's nicer to go to the large center console for that anyway. In my mind, it's probably brilliant to kill the driver console paradigm and provide a better view of the road ahead.

I'm definitely willing to give it a chance. And I predict that all cars will be like that in 20 years.

In the SF Bay area, and all through California I guess, there are a lot of car washes at Chevron gas stations. I think they are touch-less and that they are all pretty similar? I have driven through one of them before with my old Honda Civic, but I have been wary of doing that with the model 3 we got last November. One concern is high pressure of the water. Can that cause problems in anyway?

Additionally, what about the do-it-yourself carwashes where you put in some money and get like 10 minutes of high pressure soap or rinse to use. Can the high pressure do bad things? Are the areas on the car that I should avoid hitting to much with high pressure soap or rinse? Is that better or worse than the touchless Chevron drive-through car washes?

Any advice is most welcome. Mostly I am just trying to get off bug splatter and other things that might be bad for the car in the long run. I am not too concerned about a perfect appearance.

Hi! First time poster here.

I have a 2016 Model S 70D with 21K miles and rear seats added on.

I've considered buying a newer Model S (I didn't like the Model 3), but I actually really like my current car and feel no overwhelming desire for a new one.

US Bank has quoted the buyout at $59K. I was about to buy it, but wanted to make sure it's not a total rip-off.

What do you guys think?

Sure there are arguments for reasonable time, and they are already at the upper limit of that. But that's the only reason I can see for some of this hysteria.

Take a chill pill, let them resolve it, and if they can't then is the time to start making threats and considering legal actions/charge backs.

Autonomy day was a geek only event that did nothing to move the stock price, which I think was the intent as a prelude to the cap raise.

that being said...since i like Geek stuff...i really enjoyed watching it and would have been bummed to not see it.

IMO, the problem with ""autonomy day"" is that there were several really good geeky presentations by the autopilot team, followed by Elon making lunatic, unsupportable claims about robotaxis next year, and the team trying not to wince.

Shoplifting and Other Fraud Cost Retailers Nearly $50 Billion Last Year

What Does Shoplifting Do to Store Prices?


You might assume that, because shoplifting is a common problem in retail stores, store owners simply absorb the costs associated with inventory lost through shoplifting. However, store owners typically pass on the costs of shoplifting to consumers in the form of higher prices.

Tesla prices China-made Model 3 at 328,000 yuan as China plan accelerates
BEIJING (Reuters) - U.S. electric vehicle (EV) maker Tesla Inc said on Friday it would price its China-made Model 3 vehicles from 328,000 yuan ($47,529), as it pushes production and sales in the world's largest new-energy vehicle market. 

The carmaker has been building a factory in China since January where it will start producing Model 3 cars. Pre-orders for the vehicles will also start on Friday, the company said on its website.

The standard range plus Model 3 is 49,000 yuan cheaper than China's current cheapest version, also standard range plus, even though it remains unclear whether the carmaker will receive China's subsidies for new energy vehicles.

The starting prices for five different versions of China-made Model 3s range from 328,000 to 522,000 yuan. Customers can expect to receive the car in 6-10 months, the company said.

The higher-end version of the Model 3 will still be imported from the United States.

Investors are focused on whether the gross profit margin on the Model 3 will remain around 20 percent in China.

CRUCIAL PRODUCTION

Doubts about the Model 3's production rate and sales performance have hit Tesla's share price in recent months.

Producing cars locally is likely to help Tesla minimize the impact of the U.S.-China trade war, which has forced the EV maker to adjust prices of its U.S.-made cars in China. 

Keeping prices in check will also help Tesla fend off competition from a swathe of domestic EV startups such as Nio Inc, Weltmeister and XPeng Motors, as well as established carmakers including Volkswagen and General Motors.

Tesla's so-called Gigafactory is China's first wholly foreign-owned car plant and is seen as a reflection of the country's broader shift to open up its car market.

Pictures of the Shanghai plant posted on Tesla's social-media account showed construction of its main section was nearly done. The company also held a recruitment event this week for car manufacturing and logistics workers. 

Tesla forecast its delivery in 2019 would reach 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles and said it may produce as many as 500,000 vehicles if its China factory reaches volume production in the fourth quarter.

3706697,Help needed: Significantly reduced range on a P90DL - should I take delivery?,Troy,2019-05-30 17:55:00,"See the chart here. The average capacity at 41,000 miles is 95.1% and this car has 89.4% left. There is a known problem with 2015 90 kWh packs.

Also, be aware that:

The plastic nosecone in Model S produced before 12 Apr 2016 is considered old-fashioned by many people. Also, because the nosecone was discontinued in Apr 2016, it instantly communicates to everybody that this is an old model that was discontinued 3 years ago.
Model 3 Performance has Track Mode but Model S Performance doesn't. Instead, it has Limp Mode. See the discussion here. This is because of weaker battery cooling in Model S/X. See the topic here.
Model 3 supports 250 kW at Supercharger V3 stations Tesla started building. Model S supports 145 kW. However, 90 kWh packs that have heavy degradation are limited to 90 kW Supercharging based on what people are reporting. Tesla will switch Model S/X production to 2170 cells most likely at the end of Sep 2019. See the news article here. This will enable 250 kW Supercharger V3 support for Model S/X produced after 25 Sep 2019.
Check out the range table here. What the car displays is not the range you get at highway speeds. For example, P90DL has 226 miles range at 75 mph when new. That means because of degradation, this car has 226*0.894= 202 miles range at 75 mph at 100% charge. However, for day to day driving, you are supposed to charge to 90% instead of 100%. That means your daily range will be 0.9*202= 182 miles at 75 mph in summer. However, in winter you will lose between 15-30% range depending on how harsh winters are where you live. If we assume 20% winter loss, that leaves you with 0.8*182= 145 miles for day to day driving.

Can I just add that in order for everyones complaints to be valid, we need to first let Tesla try and resolve this issue. They maintain they are working on a fix. Until that fix is proven ineffective then I can see their point that people should pay for the screen.

Sure there are arguments for reasonable time, and they are already at the upper limit of that. But that's the only reason I can see for some of this hysteria.

Take a chill pill, let them resolve it, and if they can't then is the time to start making threats and considering legal actions/charge backs.

If you can't wait, and have a spare $1300 lying around, don't let me stop you either.
""

Tesla is not giving any time guarantees. ""We are working on it"" for 2 years is not reasonable by most people's standards. It doesn't help the situation they are are also saying ""this is not covered under warranty at all, so we're doing you a favor if we fix it"" - that official stance combined with lack of any timelines and the fact that they've been unsuccessful at resolving this for 2 years now, is why people are getting upset. Is it is difficult for you to understand?

PS> Once they take an official ""this is not under warranty"" stance, they force people to go down some legal paths to declare it otherwise.

I am not kidding, that I have seen a forum thread where someone had seen that the published range of the car was ""supposed"" to be 310 rated miles, and because this person saw that it charged to only 309 miles, he was worried and was calling Tesla service center to schedule an appointment to find out why his battery was going bad. Don't be that guy. And Tesla, by switching to more general terms like ""long range"" and ""short range"" is trying to help you not be that guy.

There is going to be some variation and inexactness to these measurements, so they don't want to constantly be inundated with these kinds of time wasting calls because someone sees half a kilowatt hour less than whatever the published number says.
""

Not to discount the possibilities of people looking to complain about anything, I still believe that it is a good practice to publish the specs (including battery capacity).

Chevron executive is secretly pushing anti-electric car effort in Arizona

A California lobbyist for Chevron Corp. is urging retirees of the oil company in Arizona to oppose electric-car policies here, saying the vehicles are too expensive for most people and should not be promoted.

A handful of people who either retired from Chevron or from Unocal, which Chevron acquired in 2005, have used the form letter to urge Arizona Corporation Commissioners not to require electric companies here to build electric-car charging stations.

Form letters are commonly used to lobby commissioners, but the secretive nature of this campaign has drawn criticism, including from a retiree who alerted commissioners to the lobbyist's effort.

The letters discourage electric-car infrastructure.

""Let the electric vehicle industry finance the construction of the infrastructure from which it will benefit, rather than burdening most Arizona ratepayers with the costs of supporting the electric vehicle market,"" wrote Sel Larsen, the president of the Arizona retirees group.

See the chart here. The average capacity at 41,000 miles is 95.1% and this car has 89.4% left. This car has 5.7% less capacity left than the average at this mileage. There is a known problem with 2015 90 kWh packs. Also, be aware that:

The plastic nosecone in Model S produced before 12 Apr 2016 is considered old-fashioned by many people. The nosecone instantly communicates to everybody that this is an old model that was discontinued 3 years ago.
Model 3 Performance has Track Mode but Model S Performance doesn't. Instead, it has Limp Mode. See the discussion here. This is because of weaker battery cooling in Model S/X. See the article here.
Model 3 supports 250 kW at Supercharger V3 stations Tesla started building. Model S will support 145 kW. However, 90 kWh packs that have heavy degradation are limited to 90 kW Supercharging based on what people are reporting. I expect Tesla to switch Model S/X production to 2170 cells most likely at the end of Sep 2019. See the news article here. This will enable 250 kW Supercharger V3 support for Model S/X produced after 25 Sep 2019.
Check out the range table here. What the car displays is not the range you get at highway speeds. For example, P90D with 21"" wheels has 226 miles range at 75 mph when new. That means because of degradation, this car has 226*0.894= 202 miles range at 75 mph at 100% charge. However, for day to day driving, you are supposed to charge to 90% instead of 100%. That means your daily range will be 0.9*202= 182 miles at 75 mph in summer. However, in winter you will lose between 15-30% range depending on how harsh winters are where you live. If we assume 20% winter loss, that leaves you with 0.8*182= 145 miles for day to day driving.
Teslas produced before 28 Mar 2019 have Autopilot 2.5 hardware. After that, production switched to AP3.0. There is a huge difference between these versions. AP3.0 is 16 times more powerful. See the video here.
Model 3 Performance costs $59,900 - $3750= $56,150 and comes standard with basic Autopilot. You could consider a new Model 3 P.

""

Thank you for all this information, it's excellent.

I knew there was something wrong with 10% battery degrad at 41,000 miles, and apparently I was more or less right by saying it should be 5% instead. 

About the nosecone - well, a Model S refresh is apparently coming soon, so the new nose will also be considered old by then.

I unfortunately can't do Model 3 (or any new custom Tesla). Because of where I live, I can only supercharge, and having to pay for supercharging would basically mean I'd have to 'pay for gas' all the time, which defeats one of the purposes for EV driving. I did consider Model 3 very seriously until I remembered that fact. A new car (instead of used) that can do 3.2 sec 0-60 (instead of like 2.8... still super fast) with updated tech and higher range for actually cheaper sounds like an excellent deal. but I can't get over having to pay every time I charge.

It depends on how you're going to use the car. There are some folks who drive no more than 120 miles per week and there are others who are driving 120 miles each day. I'd say the only times I wish I had more than 250 miles of range is during a road-trip. I find myself driving for 2 hours, then pulling over to rest/eat/charge for 40 minutes. I'm looking forward to the new 370 range mile Model S where the driving to charging ratio will likely be 3hrs to 40min. However, during the work week the car could have just 150 miles of range and it would make no difference for us. 

So my questions are:

1) How many miles do you plan to drive in a day or week?

2) Do you plan on taking road trips with it?

3) Do you plan on upgrading to a longer range Tesla in the next 3-5 years?
""

1) I don't have a commute, so I don't really drive that much apart from making a 20-30 mile trip about every weekend.
2) Yes :| I've taken plenty with my 85D which I believe still has like 260 miles.

Today I was on a two-lane road, not on AP and guess I experienced the ELDA from comments here. I posted about it under a 2019.16.2 thread along with other observations of the update. First time ever encounting it. I was going around a curve (outer side) with another car approaching me from the other direction. Saw a red alert on the screen, heard warning beeps, and the message said something like ""Steering corrected for your safety"". I'm pretty sure I was fairly centered in my lane but thought maybe the other driver was too close to the center line. I had both hands on the wheel and didn't feel any jerk so any correction it did in my case was pretty mild. The warning beeps can be jarring especially when you don't expect them like this first time with the feature activated so I can imagine if this one-time event I experience had gone on many times during my trip could see it making you feel less secure in your car. Sounds like they'll be fine tuning it and getting a lot of shared data feedback on it. 

Since the car wasn't taken far off path in my case, after it happened I thought it was probably a nice feature to have. If you aren't paying attention and traveling at a decent speed it doesn't take long to deviate out of your lane and off the road for example. Not sure about the amount of steering correction involved as I said I don't think I felt a pull or jerk.

You know that if the 3 of us are thinking about adding TSLA but hesitant due to the price action, this is undoubtedly what many TSLA longs/buyers are feeling right now. There are lots of buyers just waiting right now. Shorts are continuing to pressure the stock without much covering even after such a huge drop because buyers aren't forcing them to cover. That's what is missing so far compared with all prior big drops.

Ultimately, what underlies this drop is market uncertainty over demand. Jonas used the delta in total deliveries between Q1 and Q4 2018 to make his point. Deliveries were down sequentially by 1/3. This can only be definitively refuted with increased deliveries. Unfortunately, one quarter of increased deliveries probably won't be enough to undue the damage, but it will help. Many analysts will likely ignore sequential increase in deliveries for Q2 vs Q1. That's just the way it is right now.

If we get good delivery numbers, how far will the stock climb? It will require significant volume to clear resistance levels above us, particularly the upper channel line, which may be perhaps around $230 at that point. That would be about a 25% climb from the $185 low so far, which is what I would expect based on historical stock movement. I think the upper limit would probably be the 50 MA, perhaps $245ish, depending upon when we get there. The upper bollinger band is way up at $268. I do not think that is likely on the first bounce, but you never know. The other question is, where do we find support after we get a pullback after the bounce. We need to get out of this trend and make a higher low. A lot of people will be looking to make a buck on the bounce, and there will be plenty of selling when it looks like the bounce is starting to get sold. Where will buyers step back in on that pullback?

I think I need to make one thing clear here: there is a wide gulf between whether or not this woman committed gross negligence (your words, not mine), and culpability on Tesla's part.

3706871,Tesla forced an update of my P85D to 2019.16.2,jdjeff88,2019-05-30 19:01:00,"HankLloydRight said:
↑

3 major revisions? I was on 8.1. The next major revision is 9.0. That's one major revision. I don't know how many people, if any, are 3 major revisions back. But the gist of this conversation is how broken the user interface is between 8.1 and 9.0, and not any older version.



And this matters why? Nothing I and the others are complaining about has anything to do with Autopilot. It's all about the broken main UI. All of it.



Well, of course they're not going to think a new software release is going to be a downgrade. Not sure what that adds here.



There's more than a few people complaining about the V9 UI. And it's fallen on deaf ears. All Tesla needs to do is publish a white paper on why they did what they did, and why it's better, and how it's safer, and the research, data, and UI/UX testing to back it up. But they don't have any of that.. it's like talking to a black box, and we just have to swallow whatever is handed down without complaint in the name of 'progress'. Sorry, not going to happen.

Sorry if that was a clickbait title, but this just gets to me:

New lawsuit against Tesla alleges that a Model X pinned a pregnant woman against a wall, breaking her bones and sending her into premature labor (TSLA)

My news aggregator showed me that story last night since it knows I enjoy reading Tesla news, and it just makes me sick. I mean we clearly have a case of a woman that had no control over her two year old child and the child drove the car into her. I know this may sound harsh, and I sympathize with the difficulty of being a parent (I have three young kids myself), but it's fools like this that want to make the entire world idiot proof that prevent decent individuals from having nice things. This is not the view of a Tesla apologist; rather, it's a plea for people in these types of situations to own responsibility for their (and their children's) actions. This could be any car company and it would be just as wrong.

I relented and accepted the VIN with 150+ miles. Now the MVPA is stating this was a previous service/demo vehicle.

My DC stated my car was slated to be a marketing vehicle but was reassigned to a customer. It has the miles becuase it had to be transported from one center to another. 

The VIN is newly built on 04/10/2019, so it has HW3 and what not. I'm just leery of her explanation on the condition.

That could be true, (the bolded part) but it doesnt have to be... any more than when you are looking at a used BMW / Mercedes on a lot and the salesman says ""Oh yeah, that was owned by a little old lady who basically only drove it to church and back... hell of a deal, better get it now"".

There is no law that says that what they SAY to you has to be true. One always hopes it is, and as an explanation for 150 miles its plausable.. but if the miles bothered you, you should have refused the car, and made them deliver you a new one. Either decide to just let it go completely NOW, or, return the car and start over if you still have time.

I wanted a ""new"" car so I would not have accepted a car with that many miles, unless the discount was similar to if I was buying a USED car with 150 miles (so at least 2-3k off or, in tesla land, free paint and wheel upgrade).",,0,0,0,0

There is a vast split between the younger generations and older generations in this country. I try to take into account that older generations always think the young are the end of everything and we've managed to muddle through, but this time there may actually be a very deep generational rift, at least in politics..
""

It's a huge, huge rift, and it's right around the 1974 birth year, just so you know.



What we need is a candidate who will appeal to the center and the right of center disgusted with Trump.
""

No. The ""center"" is mythical -- you've been studying politics, you should know this by now.

What we need is a candidate who is, and comes across as, honest and straightforward and a real reformer. And Biden looks this way to people who haven't bothered to look at his record. But as soon as his record is pulled out in the general election, all those right-of-center people will abandon him -- just as they abandoned John Kerry, who actually was honest but was made to look otherwise.




The middle of the electorate just want the madness to end.
""

There is no middle of the electorate. You really haven't been paying attention to the studies on this, have you?

These are the groups:
(1) Establishment Democrats (Habitual Democratic Voters)
(2) Left-wing Democrats
(3) Left-wingers who won't call themselves Democrats because of Democratic Party corruption
(4) Right-wing Religious Fanatics (some are abandoning voting because of Republican corruption)
(5) Fascists (these are now very loyal to the Republicans)
(6) Habitual Republican Voters (these are reachable)
(7) Right-wingers who won't call themselves Republicans because of Republican Party corruption
(8) People with radical views some of which are left and some of which are right, who are in neither party -- there are actually quite a lot of these.

There is NO mushy middle. The studies make this super clear. 
Jim Hightower said the only thing in the middle of the road was dead armadillos.

The people in group (8) can be won over by just getting one policy they care about right, and being *convincing about actually executing it*, because group (8) is very very cynical. Serve up an ""establishment"" figure, and you lose all of them. They'll vote for Sanders because of his sincerity and consistency, or for Gary Johnson, but never for a Hillary or a Biden.

Look at Beto and how well he did in Texas of all places. Did he do well by being ""moderate""? Absolutely not. He did well by being genuine and grassroots.

Biden sort of seems genuine and grassroots on a shallow viewing, but as soon as his record of promoting debt slavery and helping bankers starts being noticed...



Because of this, there is a better than average chance Trump may not be the Republican candidate in 2020.
""

That would definitely change things.



The US has the different party systems that switch every 30-50 years and the US is ripe for another one. At the end of a party system cycle there is a sense the old ideas are stale and not working anymore and people are ripe for something new, a new direction. That's happening in the US.
""

That's why Biden's a god-awful candidate.



The midterm elections were not only a rebuke of Trump, but also a sign of that thirst for change.
""

Yes.



If the trend continues, the next Congress will likely be more progressive than this one. Biden is a moderate, but he will likely go along with a Congress that's more liberal than what he's used to. His political career started during the unraveling of the New Deal party system and the bulk of it was during the conservative Reagan party system. He had to adopt to more conservative ideals because that's the way the political winds were blowing. But he also has evolved with the time. He embraced same sex marriage quite quickly and he says he now regrets some of his more conservative moves in the past.
""

I hope he manages to stop looking like The Stale Old Ideas, but he looks awfully like The Stale Old Ideas right now.

My priority is a candidate who looks new. ANY of the other candidates has at least one signature plan for changing SOMETHING which everyone agrees is broken and has been broken for a long time. Whether it's Buttegieg or Beto or Cory Booker or even Harris. Several have picked healthcare -- and a majority of Republicans support single-payer according to the last polling I read!

Hi! Firstly there are 2 tesla Superchargers in Dubai and a number of others planned around Abu Dhabi and new destinations, do you drive past any of the locations where you can charge the car ? Is 155 miles a round trip (going there and back) or only single journey ? The AC will run fine in those temperatures. Overall the X will be a nicer place than the X5. There are plenty of Tesla’s in Dubai and the government are encouraging EV adoption with more local charging spots.

No it’s a stupid new “feature”.

Tesla decided that if you just “plug-in” at X% it should try to hold it there. Regardless if you want to “charge” or not.

I no longer keep my Tesla plugged in to keep it “happy” because the owner is not happy with this behavior. Basically it’s to prevent (cover up) phantom losses.

If they want to have stupid behavior like this please make it an option. Or at least allow the user to set hysteresis thresholds other than 0.1% (or what ever ridiculously small value they use because it is as little as what you phantomly lose in about 1 hr).

Some people have off peak metering or other charge restrictions. It should not just be randomly charging. This would be really dumb on a cold pack as well.

Supposedly if it has a scheduled charge it won’t do this.

This was my initial assumption too, but it does it so inconsistently that it makes me wonder if this is really what is going on or not.

Here's my theory:

The fans ramp up but the louvers in the front grill don't open, creating the initial very loud fan noise.

Not expecting the unexpected doesn't make her very smart either. Kids don't just look out the window when they're sitting in the driver's seat of cars.

It's very clear she doesn't take responsibility of much by their argument in the lawsuit. 



In a letter Gokal wrote to Tesla, she explains the child did lodge himself between the accelerator and driver’s seat, then pulled the gear lever before accelerating into his mom. But this lawsuit alleges the Model X’s poor design is at fault.

“That’s their whole argument is that vehicle doesn’t operate like a normal car. It’s so easy that a child that’s not even potty trained can some how operate it and send it full throttle,” Gokal said.

Lets call it 60K in saving to be sure VAT on Autopilot is included.

SO $9,000US in savings. That's quite a bit...
Altho I thought $3K in saving was nice too since that's around 7% off.

BUT I guess the bears will be along soon to tell us how it actually costs more some how. And since there is 7% in savings there is no way the Chinese version can be at profit because it's SO expensive to manufacture products in China.

New lawsuit against Tesla alleges that a Model X pinned a pregnant woman against a wall, breaking her bones and sending her into premature labor (TSLA)

My news aggregator showed me that story last night since it knows I enjoy reading Tesla news, and it just makes me sick. I mean we clearly have a case of a woman that had no control over her two year old child and the child drove the car into her. I know this may sound harsh, and I sympathize with the difficulty of being a parent (I have three young kids myself), but it's fools like this that want to make the entire world idiot proof that prevent decent individuals from having nice things. This is not the view of a Tesla apologist; rather, it's a plea for people in these types of situations to own responsibility for their (and their children's) actions.

Just noticed that they doubled the number of HPWCs at the Indianapolis service center has been increased from 10 to 15ish. But what’s more interesting is they have added 2 Superchargers. These appear to be traditional v2 SC (not urban or v3). They are mounted on a steel pallet but the pallet looks like it is a permanent fixture. It doesn’t look like there will be any more installed. These SCs don’t show up on the car navigation and are probably intended for use by the service center however my wife charged there after closing hours and they worked five

I got my M3 tinted about 4 weeks ago at a place with very good yelp reviews. The guy has done a lot of M3s.

Washed my car today and noticed several spots where the tint has a bubble or cracks.

The guy said he will re-tint the entire back window, if he cannot fix the problem areas.

Question: will it mess up my rear defroster lines if I let him remove the tint and reapply tint? Or is it pretty safe to redo?

A family member was scheduled to take delivery of an SR with 660 miles on it. The car was supposedly used as a demo vehicle. They only offered $440 off MSRP so I personally would have passed on it but he wanted to move forward and placed a deposit on it.

When we went to pick it up it had over 1,000 miles on it, and they still did not want to discount it more than $440. So we rejected it and placed an order for a new one, which he took delivery of a few days ago.

Don’t be afraid to reject a car that you are not happy with. They are building at least 5,000 of these a week. If you don’t like the one they assign to you, another one will come along shortly.

This is dynamic I had not anticipated before, but we could see diesel and gasoline demand become much more volatile as EVs become the low opex vehicles of choice. To use a rough analogy from power generation, EVs are becoming ""baseload"" transport, while fossil powered vehicles become the ""peaking"" transport. In any case, the peaking role or backup role leads to much more seasonality and volatility of fuel demand.
""

Makes sense. Luckily, it's quite possible to store fossil fuels, which makes them great for peaking transport applications. Whereas it's more expensive to store electricity. So when the seasonal peak hits, we will see diesel supplies drawn down, and then during the other months when there's no demand, they'll slowly be replenished. The refineries *should* see the seasonality averaged out to some extent by local storage -- bus fleets often have their own diesel tanks at their bus bases.",,0,0,0,0

My house has 50 kW service. I don't see how a couple of 144 kW Superchargers are going to make much difference in a business electric service.
""

Where I live, 96 kW (400 A 240 V) peak is the limit before they start requiring you to get three-phase service. It's a step change in electrical service levels.

Now do you get it? One 50 kW charger wouldn't affect much, but two 144 kW chargers means a whole new three-phase service.

Obviously if Tesla uses Powerpacks to buffer the battery power draw at the Supercharger, and the charger wasn't being used 24-7, they wouldn't actually need this service level from the grid. But batteries are expensive and I think they're getting the grid upgrades in most places.",,0,0,0,0

Yeah, Tesla has not figured out how to make money in the used car business, not even with used Teslas. Frankly I think they should get out of it.

3707085,Papafox's Daily TSLA Trading Charts,Papafox,2019-05-30 20:27:00,"Despite the very low percent of selling by shorts number recently, I continue to believe we're seeing a fairly high level of manipulations in TSLA trading. Once again today we saw buying on open of market trading, but then saw a fade into the red even with positive macros. Part of the pressure on TSLA today was because of the Brian Johnson Barclays downgrade from $192 to $150. Johnson is a Tesla perma-bear who is taking his turn in the one-a-day stock downgrade routine that the analysts have been pulling off for several days now. 

Nonetheless, TSLA tried to shake off the red by early afternoon but then the capping to prevent TSLA from climbing above $190 went into effect and TSLA sunk back down for the remainder of the day.

Volume was on the light side of moderate today, suggesting that Tesla investors were in no hurry to either add or sell. 

The final minute of market trading yielded no less than 510,000 trades, suggesting that we're seeing a lot of wheeling and dealing with this stock. 



The NASDAQ gained 0.27% today, but Tesla's mandatory morning dip plus the Brian Johnson downgrade likely convinced traders that other stocks was where they'd make their money today, and not Tesla

Consider this article at oilprice.com so that you can better understand the mindset of Tesla's foes. We're seeing an incredible drop in the cost of generating electricity with renewables, and oil producers can see that the future of electrical production will be moving quickly to wind and solar. Further, successful EV makers (and Tesla is the only standout beyond China at the moment) are going to enable drivers to tap into that cheap electricity as an alternative to gasoline. The obvious conclusion is to forestall the inevitable pressure on oil, bad things happening to Tesla would be one of the easiest ways to slow the pain of oil moving towards becoming a niche product, not the mainstay of energy any more. 



Taking a look at the tech chart, you can see that the slender $2 dips a day and not allowing two up days in a row presents a chart that does not project a stock about to turn around. This is the aim of the manipulators, I believe, as they hold off a rally in the hopes that some macro event will dip TSLA further and continue to prevent a bounce. Time will tell but the closer TSLA gets to 180, the more difficult it will be for the manipulators.

In news late today, Tesla priced the standard range Model 3 in China at a price of 328,000 yuan ($47,529, says Reuters), coming in a bit less than a BMW 300 series sold in China. Although some Chinese buyers were hoping for a lower initial price, we may see some additional price cutting if China offers incentives for purchasing the vehicle. One advantage of getting the price out there is that buyers who were considering a U.S. built Model 3 and were sitting on the fence now can make an informed decision of wait 6-10 months or buy now. According to this TMC post by Mars Emperor, ""Shipping date for imported SRP has just jumped to August, used to be end of June."" Looks like clarification of pricing may help U.S. M3s sell better in China in the interim. 

Additional late news is that the POTUS will impose a 5% tariff on imports from Mexico and keep raising the tariff until Mexico acts to stop the border crossings. My guess is that the POTUS wants to demonstrate to China that he does indeed go ahead with promised tariffs, and if he can get cooperation from Mexico he will reward Mexico with a dropping of the tariff. I really think this move is part of the bigger picture. My guess is that Mexico will squawk and then at least ceremonially improve border security to play its role in the drama because the cost of extra guards on the border is a whole lot less than the consequences of the tariffs. The problem for Tesla is that some parts come from Mexico and they will cost more. Also, the economy could take a hit. Expect the macros to be down tomorrow.

@mikevbf , my guess is that if Model S is not going to receive another refresh in September, Tesla would clarify and remove the misinformation. If Tesla says nothing, the news is probably fairly accurate.

So far looking okay. The cars around you when stopped in traffic do seem to dance more and wish they were more true to placement. Some definitely look like they were swatting my car when I was driving on local 6-lane road and slowing down to stop.

I like the addition of the Sentry button at the top. Been using that instead of pulling out my phone to turn on in the app. At first wondered what the black dot was (turns to red eye when touched and activated).

Just a few minutes ago driving on a local 2-lane road, no center barrier, i was in lane and going into a curve (outside position) and got a red alert, warning beeps, and message in red that said something like steering was adjusted for your safety (not sure on exact wording). While I was in middle of my lane, apparently the other driver approaching me in his lane was perceived as being too close to the center line. I had both hands on the wheel, not on AP at all, and didn’t really feel a tug to the right so it was a subtle shift to the right I guess.

Haven’t used with TACC yet but not seeing anything major. Downloaded fine and I did do a two-wheel reboot after install.
""

Yup SMA that’s the ELDA alert in action and you have to turn it off before every drive. It’s not the same as lane departure avoidance which just vibrates the steering wheel. It goes off even if you don’t have TACC or Auto steer engaged.

In the last six months, motor blew out and was replaced, front door hinge failed (again) and was replaced, storage compartment sliding door failed and had to be replaced, visor broke and was replaced. This is after many, many prior issues. Latest thing is that there is a firmware bug that doesn't recognize that my software update is the latest version. Been in the shop multiple times to try to fix. Ultimately they said it is a bug that needs to be addressed in a future software update, but all the updates for at least two months are already scheduled. In the meantime, I have an error message (Software Update Required - Contact Service Center) and beep that pops up every ten seconds. Makes it almost unbearable to drive. But Tesla's response is I'm SOL.

I cancelled my Model 3 reservation and discouraged many people from buying a Tesla because of my horrible ownership experience. Car is great when it works, which is almost never.",,0,0,0,0

Sorry if that was a clickbait title, but this just gets to me:

New lawsuit against Tesla alleges that a Model X pinned a pregnant woman against a wall, breaking her bones and sending her into premature labor (TSLA)

My news aggregator showed me that story last night since it knows I enjoy reading Tesla news, and it just makes me sick. I mean we clearly have a case of a woman that had no control over her two year old child and the child drove the car into her. I know this may sound harsh, and I sympathize with the difficulty of being a parent (I have three young kids myself), but it's fools like this that want to make the entire world idiot proof that prevent decent individuals from having nice things. This is not the view of a Tesla apologist; rather, it's a plea for people in these types of situations to own responsibility for their (and their children's) actions. This could be any car company and it would be just as wrong.

Thank you for checking.

LDA is an extension of the prior LDW (see above blog post). In the picture, they show the warning message and a blue line being crossed. Previously, LDW was vibrate steering wheel only - it did NOT beep. It's impossible to know from the blog post whether LDA now has beeping as well as vibrating. But I do know that LDW has been converted from a toggle to a slider, with three options, off, warn, and assist. Anyway, that's what I would like to know - does LDA beep when in warn mode? In general I would like a complete description of the behavior of both features, but no one seems to know.

It seems quite likely that ELDA beeps, at least, because people have been talking about audible alarms. Which is also pretty bad as it seems to trigger if you cross a solid white line, or possibly even a white line that is not solid. But that is a secondary question. The blog post shows a red line being crossed with a different warning message being displayed.

I think I need to make one thing clear here: there is a wide gulf between whether or not this woman committed gross negligence (your words, not mine), and culpability on Tesla's part. This seems to be a large part of the problem with today's litigious society - the conflation of blame with wrongdoing. I never said that this woman was grossly negligent. Do I believe she carries culpability? Yes. Do I believe there could be additional safety measures applied to engage a drive mode on a Tesla? ...maybe, but there are already many that were being either deliberately or inadvertantly bypassed. Could you ask the same question of literally any system that operates at a hazard to life or health? Absolutely. 

The issue here is that the law should not be required to step in when this woman should have known what might happen when her son gets behind the wheel of the car. My oldest son pushed his younger sister off a playground bridge at the age of 4 at a height of at least 4-5 feet. She could have broken her neck from the fall. Should I blame the playground equipment manufacturer for making this possible? I have never thought to do so. On the contrary, it remains a life lesson of my own to this day.
""

Posts like this always bug me. Oversimplifying a complex issue. There may well be reasons to hold those who design and make playgrounds responsible for the safety of that equipment. Likewise a car should not be so easy to start and put into gear. 

Many years ago a neighbor put her kid in the car and ran back into the house for a moment. Unfortunately she left the engine running, a clearly bad idea that no one should ever do. The kid managed to grab the gear shift and the car rolled back into my car on the other side of the street. In the case of the model X, the car was off, parked and anyone would think it should be a bit harder than a 2 year old could manage to do to turn the car on and cause it to start moving! The issues of the car being enabled by remote devices and so easily manipulated into gear can create problems that would not be expected by most people because it is so different from other cars we are accustomed to. 

I believe most of the controls on the car are not well designed and easy to manipulate wrongly. It is not infrequent that I mix up the two left side stalks since the movements are virtually identical. The autopilot control should be on the right side next to the gear shift. The gear shift should probably be something very different. Perhaps a much stiffer movement, a shorter stalk or even buttons on the dash. Oh, that's right, we can't have buttons on the dash, that's so 20th century.",,0,0,0,0

I'm a relatively new owner of a Tesla Model 3. I set up my house for charging (with a NEMA 14-50 plug) but I will most often be charging for free at work. A few questions:
1. We have Chargepoint stations at work so we have to share charging cables when they're available. I noticed that if I plug in my J adapter into the charge port, the charging port door tries to close on it. I'd like to keep my adapter plugged in with the door open so that when a co-worker is done with their charger, they can just plug into my car. But will the charge port door keep trying to close and cause any damage?

2. When I'm plugged in, I'd like to free up my charger cable for others to use when the charging is complete. When my car detects that it's done charging (green light), will another person be able to unlock the charger cable from my car for their use?

Thanks in advance for your pointers. I couldn't find this info in the User Manual.

Dave

When I replaced my 19” winter wheels with 21” summer twin turbines, the lug nut covers wouldn’t fit with the old style stainless steel lug nuts. Since I deformed some of the soft metal on the original nuts, I ordered aftermarket ones. The threads and cones at the bottom are right, but they seem SO much smaller than the old OEM ones. Is this okay? One to replace the OEMs and another set of acorns to use with the twin turbine nut covers (although the gorilla ones fit with the covers since they are smaller.

I think the articles points are well taken, such as the lack of haptic feedback makes it difficult to invoke controls without looking at the screen which is aiso situated awkwardly forcing the driver to take their eyes off the road. A lot of the objections to touchscreens could probably be fixed if Tesla put effort into a more robust vocal assistant. A user Should be able to use voice for simple operations like adusting the climat or setting simple toggle commands on/off like lights, sentry mode , etc. that would go a long way to avoid taking your eyes off the road if you could really talk to your car!!

Hard to argue with that. I suspect it wouldn’t be hard to implement.

3707188,How and when does the 12v battery get charged?,darth_vad3r,2019-05-30 21:01:00,"Oh, so I did a followup test. I used Find my iPhone to try and check remotely if the USB and 12V outlet were powered or not based on if the two devices I left in the car plugged in charging in those 2 outlets (front driver's side USB and 12V outlet) showed 'charging' or not from a 3rd device in the Find my iPhone app. 

I didn't get super-conclusive results because I think once devices get fully charged they stop showing the lightning bolt icon 

I was able to deterimine (this was still on 2019.12.x before getting 2019.16) that the power to both front driver's side USB and the 12V power outlet seemed to cut out after 10-11 minutes (presumable car went to sleep).

I was also able to determine that turning climate control on from the app restored power to both.

Also the remotely turned on climate control turned itself off after 4 hours (I got a notification saying as much). Unlike the in car ""Keep Climate On"" which purportedly stays on 'forever' (until battery gets to 20%).

So anyways, if you are using a cooler in a 12V outlet, and you are keeping the cabin cool as well (so that the cooler will actually work), you should be fine having power to the 12V the whole time.

Well, you better not go on too long of a trip in a hydrogen-powered car because you have a very slim chance of there being a hydrogen filling station when you arrive (unless your hobby is visiting the 35 hydrogen filling stations in California). There are only 5 in the rest of the country. Plus, you're going to need lots of disposable cash because hydrogen is about 6 times as expensive as gasoline per mile (which makes it around 18 times as expensive as electricity).

I was in the car, plugged in a 12V adapter and was charging an iPad. I then unplugged the device and coincidentally started noticing the hissing coming from under the glovebox. It went away after a bit. I plugged the 12V adapter back in for a bit, then unplugged it again. Sound came back.

So my theory is that the 12V got drained a bit from charging, and after unplugging that triggered the car to decide to top up the 12V.

It's going to be really tricky to try to get service centre to ever reproduce this, but if you can easily do this by charging a device via the 12V outlet and unplugging then maybe we'll help them reproduce it and come up with a proper fix.

Overstating the devastating effect of the yellow band will not give you the results you desire.

Problem is that currently they have no real permenant solution. Some that have had screens replaced see them again yellowing with the passage of time.

""

No, nobody who's paid attention is concerned about this.

There have been a few Model S and Model X fires, but they're much rarer than gasoline car fires. Most were caused by road debris strikes or by crashes. One by being inside a garage which was on fire. Two by faulty wiring (both happened outdoors, one at a Supercharger and one during a test drive) -- the cause of the faulty wiring was humans not tightening connections properly, and since then all the connections have been robot-tightened. Faulty wiring can happen in a gas car too (dozens of BMWs and Fords have gone up in flames sitting still). There are two Model S fires of unclear history in China, still being researched, which might be arsons.

There have been, IIRC, zero Model 3 fires. (They seem to have made fire safety even better for Model 3.)

I plan to install a NEMA 14-50 now, but in the future, I'd like to (easily) upgrade to a HPWC.

Cable length: ~15 feet.

TODAY'S PLAN:
- 50A breaker
- NEMA 14-50 industrial outlet
- #6 AWG (6/3)
UMC will charge at 32A

FUTURE PLAN:
- Upgrade the breaker to 60A (there's room in my panel)
- Swap in the HPWC.
I want to make sure that I can charge at 48A.

Is #6 AWG (6/3) acceptable for the HPWC with a 60A breaker?
""

Yes, #6 AWG 3 conductor will work. Black and Red are power and white goes to power neutral on your panel. It doesn't need ground. The Home Depot link below shows the wire that will work. You can tac this to your wall with clamps if it's in the garage where your main circuit panel hopefully is, no need to run conduit. You'll need a 60 Amp breaker, and set the WC dial to #9 for 48Amp draw. Model 3 LR won't draw more than 48Amps. Make sure you tighten the wires with 35 lbs of force in the WC and the circuit panel. I soldered the stranded wire ends together to get a good connection. You're drawing 48 Amps and bad connections will create heat and could burn up your WC and wire if you're not careful. To check when charging at 48 Amps for 20 minutes the #6 wire should be slightly warm but not hot as it comes into the WC, and the WC should run cool. The charging cable to your car will be slightly warm also. If you smell burning wire then your connections aren't tight enough or good.

I drove that car for several more years. Independent private companies sprung up to do the required maintenance and also re-engineered many parts that improved the car.

A salvage parts company (Buddy Beyers) bought up all their remaining production parts, and made it into a very nice business, selling those parts to the owners as needed. His prices were much less than Bricklin was charging. Win/Win. He had fenders, doors, body panels. At one point they were putting together a few total vehicles as part of a continuation series.

Had lots of fun with the car, and ended up selling it for more than I paid for it. In that case the bankruptcy really made little difference in my ownership.

Much like Delorean, those cars got kind of a cult following with very active owners groups putting together events and gatherings.

Well, you better not go on too long of a trip in a hydrogen-powered car because you have a very slim chance of there being a hydrogen filling station when you arrive (unless your hobby is visiting the 35 hydrogen filling stations in California). There are only 5 in the rest of the country. Plus, you're going to need lots of disposable cash because hydrogen is about 6 times as expensive as gasoline per mile (which makes it around 18 times as expensive as electricity). And, no, the hydrogen filling station network is not growing significantly.

$379/month, $2878 drive off for 3 years, 20000 miles/year

I would not call that NEM. I would call that a Feed-In Tariff system.

With the NEM that is implemented in California, they total the net kWh for each TOU period and multiply it by the rate ($/kWh). They total the dollars for that billing period and add it to your annual true-up balance.

For example: (totally made up numbers)
Peak: -75kWh @ $0.32/kWh = -$24.00
Part-Peak: -200kWh @ $0.25/kWh = -$50.00
Off-Peak: 800kWh @ $0.12/kWh = $96.00
Total: $22.00

That is true net metering.
""

New to NEM. If all other months total net zero, at the annual settlement period, you will NOT be issued a check for $22, correct? This is due to the fact that (at least in my area) you would instead be credited at the wholesale rate. The $22 represents the consumer rate.",,0,0,0,0

Also, if they start production in Q4(Oct), then likely the first couple of months the output will be in the hundreds, not significant enough to post it as a promise to many.

Shorts were wrong because Tesla didn't want to raise additional funding in 2018 as instructed by the shorts.

It's true that while spending money to grow, Tesla needs funding but the shorts can only guess WHEN and can't tell Elon when!

They instructed Elon Musk to do it in 2018 and Elon Musk messed up their timing!

But timing is very important in trading:

https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/23/vocal-tesla-short-seller-has-reversed-course-driving-shares-higher/



I think you are looking at the wrong stock and wrong company.

Elon Musk has demonstrated 3 times in 16 years that by juggling the numbers around, profits has been achievable in Q3-2016, then 2 years later in Q-3 and 4 2018.

It is not that Tesla cannot produce profits. It can at the expense of growth.

So, it just doesn't want to for the sake of growth.

If you ask for profits, look somewhere else.

I quoted this before and as a broken record, I rep-quote it again:

Form 8-K. August 7, 2013 Shareholder Letter:

""While profits were still modest in absolute terms and not our primary mission, income increased by 70% from last quarter, driven by record Model S deliveries and a significant improvement in automotive gross margin.""
""

Yes, your post is a massive cry for help to actually understand how a company works. You pull isolated facts and try to support your conclusions. In particular, quoting Musk from six years ago is not terribly relevant. 

I don't see how you can't understand that at this point in the life of Tesla, they need to make annual profits on a regular basis. They can't continue to draw on bonds and sell stock. That's part of why the stock price has dropped over a third this past year. If they don't make profit, they won't be able to keep their doors open no matter what the company charter says. In fact, Musk himself said something like that recently. Why didn't you quote that? 

Talking about ""the shorts"" is a bit off target. The shorts don't tell anyone what to do. If anything they will tell the company to do what is bad for them so they go under making them the most profit. The stock analysts will give their opinions on what a conventional company would do to operate the company most profitably. The capital raise is a perfect example. They could have done that a year ago in much more favorable conditions. But Musk let his ego get in the way and didn't do what the analysts recommended. Ok, he pulled off another round of capital investment. I don't know how many more he can manage. Profits are the way of the future. What a novel idea!",,0,0,0,0

I think the 6-10 months is conservative.
The last thing Tesla want to do is overpromise. I like this underpromise.
Plus, the longer people have to wait, the more likely they will buy imported version now.




The saving of driving a EV in China is substantial.
Basically, if you charge at home, the cost per km (or per mile, doesn't matter) is about 10% of gas.
In Shanghai, electricity cost can be 0.33 CNY per KW, which is about 0.05 dollar.
And that would translate to 0.05 CNY per KM, which is about 0.007 dollar per KM,

I'll say that again.
That is 0.7 US cent per km, or 1.1 US cent per mile, which is crazy.

Do I need to open accounts with each of the different companies that run the charging stations ahead of time?
""

Welcome to Tesla ownership!

I do recommend a bit of reading first. Tesla actually has a lot of good info on their web site.

Home Charging Installation

I also wrote up a couple of articles, but they are fairly technical:
https://www.article625.com/2019/05/01/how-should-i-charge-my-tesla/

Tesla Mobile Connector Gen 2 vs Wall Connector – Article625.com

If you do end up with a NEMA 14-50 or 6-50 receptacle at home as your solution you will need to buy a $35 adapter since Tesla no longer includes the 14-50 by default. Order now as they have been having stocking issues!

Mostly on the road you will just need the included J1772 adapter, but if you want to be able to charge of friends dryers plugs or RV sites you may want a handful of different adapters (you can go as crazy with this as you want, but it is generally not necessary).

Yes, you will need to pay 3rd party stations (Tesla will auto bill your credit card for use of their superchargers), but that is generally easily done by downloading an app. Yes, you can also order physical charging cards (which I have done), but in most cases the app works fine too. There are only a couple third party charging networks I have ever used, and these are mostly just for “fun” rather than necessity. (YMMV)

Come on, don't say that is FUD, it was me who said 300,000 is a psychological barrier 
And my logic still stand. If price is below 300K, sales will be off the chart.

But right now, the 328K price tag encourages people to go for the 377K imported version.

Also, Model 3 from Giga Shanghai should be eligible for subsidy (not confirmed, could be wrong, but in theory yes), which will indeed make it sub 300K. But for the same reason, Tesla will not tell people until delivery is near.

And when the subsidies fade out completely by then end of next year, Giga Shanghai will surely have finished the ramp, and could drop price a little bit.


Another thing I want to point out to you is that 328K does not include Autopilot, which is 27,800 yuan.

Thuis kan ik niet laden. Ik woon 4-hoog en de gemeente plaatst geen laadpaal op de parkeerplaats. In hoeverre zou je mij een Tesla adviseren als je alleen openbaar kan laden?

Dit zou voor mij de eerste keer zijn dat ik een gloednieuwe auto ga aanschaffen. Eerder kocht ik alleen occasions. Wat kan je zeggen mbt de afschrijving van een Tesla ten opzichte van een ‘oudewetse’ auto?

En laatste vraag: ik zou de auto contant helemaal kunnen aanschaffen. Zou je dan financial lease adviseren of meteen alles zelf betalen?

Dank jullie wel voor de hulp",,0,0,0,0

New to NEM. Let's assume the $22 is a credit. If all other months total net zero, at the annual settlement period, you will NOT be issued a check for $22, correct? This is due to the fact that (at least in my area) you would instead be credited at the wholesale rate. The $22 represents the consumer rate.
""

This is an area of nuance which depends on the state and the utility. My utility is PG&E in Northern California. If PG&E is also your energy provider (ie. you didn't sign up with a DA provider or CCA) then they will only issue a check if you are a net generator. That means that at the end of the year you exported more kWh to the grid than you consumed from the grid. It is possible to have a couple hundred dollar credit balance due to TOU differentials on retail energy prices and have it wiped out because you were not a net generator. The Net Surplus Compensation for net surplus kWh is ""wholesale"" at about 3.5c/kWh.
On the other hand, if you are on a CCA (Community Choice Aggregation) then they have their own policies for the generation portion of the bill that they handle. Most will actually cut you a check for credit balances based on retail generation rates whether you are a net surplus generator or not. PG&E will still wipe out your credit balance on the transmission and distribution part of your bill at true-up and of course you have to pay the minimum delivery charges of ~$10/mo every month as well.",,0,0,0,0

We need to pick someone principled -- it almost doesn't matter what the principle actually *is*, which is why most of the other candidates are fine. (Tulsi Gabbard would probably be worse.)
""

There are some parallels with Kerry, but there is also the fact that very often the reelection of a sitting president is an initiative on the incumbent. Nate Silver has pointed out that no sitting president with an approval rating below 48% has ever won reelection. Very frequently the popular vote mirrors the approval rating of the president on election day. In 2004 Bush's approval rating was almost exactly 50% and he got less than a percent over 50%.

Incumbent presidents rarely get more or less than a few percent from their approval ratings. In 2012 Obama got a bit more largely because Romney flamed out in the stretch. But he was still within the historic spread.

Trump is facing the fact that over 50% of the population despise him and more than 50% say in polls they will definitely not vote for him for any reason. The only way he wins is by keeping those people from voting, or getting the opposition vote split between multiple candidates. Or lose big in some big states and pull off a lot of small margin squeakers in some smaller states like he did in 2016. Or a combination of all of the above.



----

In general, throughout US history, governors (and generals) have the best chance of winning the Presidency. Senators are TERRIBLE at winning the Presidency, and we shouldn't nominate them.

I suspect this is because governors and generals are correctly perceived as having executive experience, whereas legislators don't have that experience. Also, Senators develop the wrong attitude for Presidential campaigns, I think. *Sitting* vice presidents are a close third after governors and generals, probably because they're ""anointed"" by their predecessor, but Biden's not a sitting VP. An Obama endorsement could make the difference there, if he got it, which I don't think he would.

So tactically, the best options are Steve Bullock, Jay Inslee, or John Hickenlooper -- the three governors running. They have wildly different platforms, but they're governors. If you want a ""conservative"", the best choices for the general election so far are Bullock or Hickenlooper (depending on which ""conservative"" issues you think are more salient).

Personally I think Bullock -- he's staked out ""left-wing"" positions on cases where a lot of right-wingers agree with the ""left-wing"" position, like opposing Citizens United.

More governors might enter the race, though.

But anyway, tactical rule: to win the general election, nominate a governor. NOT a Senator.
""

This is true, though recent trends have bucked that. Of the major party nominees over the last 20 years, there have been only two governors (Bush and Romney). 4 senators have been major party nominees (Kerry, McCain, Obama, and HRC), though Hillary had a stint as Secretary of State in between.

I do agree having executive experience is a plus for the job. Bullock isn't a bad choice, though I think he has a better chance of winning the Senate in Montana. I wish some of these candidates who are long shots for the Democratic nomination would aim for Senate seats. The Democrats need to flip some red state senate seats in 2020 if they are going to get anywhere.

There are very few Democrats running for president who I don't think would be a reasonable choice, though I agree with you about Gabbard, she's sort of the Democrat's answer to Michelle Bachman.

Agreed in spades. If Trump were smart, and Putin is, so it is hard to tell if the Orange is pushing Biden because he wants to run against him. Nixon not only selected McGovern, but his VP too through leak to the press.
""

Putin wants the west so badly disrupted that he has free reign to do what he wants. He wants both Europe and the US in chaos. 

Rick Wilson still has a lot of friends within the GOP ranks and even gets inside dirt from within the White House. According to Wilson of all the Democrats running, Trump is most scared of Biden. Trump is not the strategic thinking Nixon was. He can't really plan anything, so he's not trying to manipulate the field to get the opponent he wants to run against. He's trying to destroy his worst enemy before that enemy is in a position to take him on directly. Trump is a 2 dimensional thinker that way.

At some point big business has got to pull the strings and remove Trump through the 25th amendment. There should be a helluva backlash against the blanket Mexico tariff. Putin's goal is now to destroy the economy. (I now draw no distinction between Trump and Putin. What a great anti-christ.)
""

It will be interesting to see what big business interests do with the constant attacks on the economy. 

Mexico can't stop the flow of immigrants coming here because you can't stop thousands of individuals from doing something. It didn't work with alcohol, doesn't work for recreational drugs, doesn't work for prostitution, and it doesn't work for immigration. If enough people want to do something that is illegal, there is no way to really stop them, no matter how good your police are. More heavy handed policing just drives the activity further underground.

If Trump carries through on his threats with Mexican tariffs (you can never be sure of anything with him, he could be running around the White House lawn with his pants around his ankles tomorrow morning), it will have an even bigger impact on the US economy. Because of NAFTA, a lot of parts to things made in the US are made in Mexico. Elon said that production of the Model S was once stopped because a gang war at the border prevented a truck load of trunk carpet from getting to Fremont. 

Trump is also so stupid and so stubborn he still believes that China and Mexico pay the tariffs. Despite being told many times.

The Evangelicals might also bolt the GOP over abortion rights. If these crazy bans win in the Supreme Court, they will have gotten their big victory and when they look at all the other things the GOP is doing, they might just abandon them. On the other hand Wilson has an interesting thought that Roberts might vote with the liberals to end the abortion madness once and for all by strengthening Rode v Wade from an implicit right to an absolute right. That might cause Evangelicals to abandon the GOP too as they will see all their effort for nearly 40 years go down the tubes. They might wake up to the fact that the current president ticks off all their boxes for the anti-christ and may determine they lost because they backed the anti-christ?",,0,0,0,0

Pretty sure that is in fact for Type 2 CCS (mostly Europe, some other places). But it's existence does make a Type 1 CCS for North America happening eventually at least plausible. Many stated over and over that it couldn't be done due to rules set for by the CCS organization, but that doesn't seem to be the case. I'm hopeful we see one eventually, though perceptually a CHAdeMO adapter is more important to have now than a CCS adapter for North America I expect that will change over time.
""

Please note that the charge port design of the Model 3 is different in Europe: the European Model 3 can’t supercharge via the upper part of the CCS port (the type 2 part), and all European superchargers have been updated to dual type2/ccs connectors.

↑

The concept of frequency-dependent selection provides a useful extension of the evolution analogy. This is when the fitness of a phenotype increases as the frequency of that phenotype increases. This phenomenon is well documented in nature, particularly with traits that involve signalling, such as warning coloration.

Analogies to EVs (and other technologies) are pretty obvious, and boil down to the notion that as adoption becomes more widespread, the utility of a technology increases for one reason or another. For example, as the frequency of the EV ""phenotype"" increases, the network of charging stations to serve them increases in density, thereby increasing the ""fitness"" of EVs still further: ergo, positive frequency-dependent selection. You can see that the converse can also be true. ICE vehicles will eventually experience negative frequency-dependent selection: as they fall in frequency, filling stations will start to close, reducing their ""fitness"" (i.e. utility). These obviously aren't novel observations, and are discussed (sans evolutionary metaphor) at length in various threads here.

However, a return to the original comment about stealing market share from hybrids with this context may offer a more novel observation. At first glance, I don't see a reason why hybrids should experience similar positive density-dependent selection. As the frequency of hybrids goes up, what intrinsic feature of a hybrid, or what accompanying infrastructure, would increase their ""fitness""? They still fill up at gas stations, so contribute to positive frequency-dependent fitness of traditional ICE vehicles. I don't think the experience of owning a hybrid has appreciably changed since the first generation Prius, at least not as a result of the much higher frequency of hybrids in the market today. I suppose you could argue that larger market share has produced economies of scale that have driven down costs of hybrid components, but I'm not sure that really counts - hybrids still typically cost more than their ICE counterparts.

Meanwhile, as EV market share has grown, the ownership experience has gotten dramatically better, and the ""fitness"" of EVs has increased in step with their frequency. We see the results of this when members of this forum share anecdotes about how they've convinced friends and family who aren't ""early adopters"" to buy a Tesla.

Another interesting application of this evolutionary thinking would be to predict the fates of the morass of charging standards.
""

Ah, this is really nice. It seems the frequency-dependent selection would relate the economists not of economy of scale and experience or learning curves. Specifically the experience curve seems dependent on sufficient opportunities to cut costs as a supply chain scales up. If scale increases do not actually lead to unit cost reductions, then the experience curve wont work. But empirically we see that some technologies or products have faster experiences curves than others. For example, solar has a faster learning rate than wind. (I don't recall specific numbers off the top of my head, but a simple web search should find it quickly.) So there seems to be something inherently different between solar and wind. But this learning rate is very important to understand how wind had reached grid price parity and scaled up sooner, but that solar looks to surpass wind both on low cost and scale. I think it may have something to do with the physical scale differences. Wind turbines get performance gains and lower unit cost mostly by increasing the size of the turbine. But going big makes turbines more difficult and costly to produce and install. Solar, however, realized performance gain by improvements at scales approaching the nanoscale. So I think this has something to do with the differences, but maybe there are frequency-dependent factors at work too.",,0,0,0,0

I'm really excited to get my car but I can't understand charging to save my life. I am going to get a Nema 14-50 outlet in my house. I know I will sometimes need to charge on the road and at hotels and all those plugs look different (and pretty quickly after I get my M3 SR+). Do I have to buy a bunch of different adapters to match the charging spots I expect to use? Does my car come with any adapters or way to charge the thing at all? If so, what does it come with and what can I plug that in to. And then it looks like a number of the charging stations are not Tesla stations. Do I need to open accounts with each of the different companies that run the charging stations ahead of time?
""

If you are bothering to install a 14-50 outlet, don't rule out installing a Wall Connector instead.

It's a nice piece of mind to keep the ""portable"" connector in the car. That way you're never without it by accident, less *sugar* to worry about. So if you do keep a UMC in the car you need to get a second dedicated one for home.
A UMC should have the 14-50 outlet Ground Fault Protected which raises the price of the 14-50 install by a $100 or so.
If you choose a Wall Connector it only costs a little more than a UMC ($500 vs $275) but the Wall Connector does not need the Ground Fault protection (because it's hardwired) so the difference is a $125. Labor should be that different.

On long range Model 3 the wall connector will charge faster on the 50A circuit than the UMC. I'm not sure about the SR+ though.

Wall Connector is better suited for outside use. Can be tied to another Wall Connector to charge multiple Tesla's and balance the load on a single circuits. It can be dialed into any amperage you want, or might change too in the future. You can take it with you if you move and have an electrician replace it with a 14-50 outlet.

People automatically think ""14-50"" outlet when they really should think ""Wall Connector"".

Toch kunnen al die oplaadproblemen voor thuis vrij gemakkelijk opgelost worden door simpelweg een lader buiten de auto te houden en de auto's DC te laden. Met een paar kleine softwareupdates kunnen ze waarschijnlijk ook verschillende merken doen, mochten ze er echt iets van willen maken kunnen ze er zelfs een eigen accu in verwerken en zonnepanelen aan kunnen sluiten op een dergelijk apparaat.

This is a solid piece of data analysis:
Lord Ashcroft: My EU election poll. Most former Tory voters say they will stay with their new party at the next election. | Conservative Home

So the UK's party system is realigning. As usual, the left wing is more splintered than the right-wing. (This is why right-wingers like ""first past the post"" -- it disadvantages more splintered coalitions and advantages more-unified minority groups like the right-wingers.) But the new alignment is Leave vs. Remain, with Leave voting Brexit or (fewer voters) Tory, and Remain voting SNP in Scotland, and LibDem, Labour, or Green elsewhere.

The Tories and Labour voters are basically habit voters, so they'll disappear as time goes on unless the parties are revitalized. The LibDem and Green voters are more committed, with LibDems caring most about Remain, and Green voters caring more about other things. The Brexit voters are just angry meaning that Brexit Party won't have staying power. The SNP voters are *strongly* committed to the SNP -- Scotland will stay 100% SNP for decades to come.

It's a curse that the UK doesn't have proportional representation yet, because it might lead to Farage as prime minister. If the UK did have proportional representation, he'd have no chance: a coalition led by the LibDems, with the Greens, SNP, and Labour supporting, would most likely win the next election. But with first-past-the-post, Brexit Party could win.

Dangerous times. I wish the election system had been fixed. It may become critical for traditional Labor voters to vote LibDem, and I doubt they'll do it.

I do the same as I leave work (or from anywhere not Home) and it routes me Home. I always look forward to finding out which way it will take me home that day.

Also, to see available Superchargers even when not planning a trip - you can click on the lower right of the screen. That will reveal a lightning bolt icon. Click that icon and it will display all the SCs on your screen map.

On a crass political level I can’t imagine Trump or his voters would appreciate committee after committee in the House uncovering duplicity, corruption, yada, yada, and high crimes and misdemeanors for months at a time in 2020 in the heat of the presidential campaign. What a publicity show this could be nailing the guy again, and again. Who cares whether the House votes on the actual articles of impeachment? It’s showtime!

Obviously you can’t impeach successfully as the Senate is presently constituted and recent history suggests they are not viable until the public reaches a widespread feeling it must be done. That preparation is underway already.

This has to be a secret strategy otherwise it will just be viewed as a political stunt. However, it will be anyway, and even the Mueller report is being played by Trump now as just a Democratic political concoction. So what’s the risk? It will be portrayed by Trump’s defenders as just a political ploy but aren’t High Crimes and Misdemeanors just the highest of what is political? 

What is crucial is timing. One trigger will be the actual refusal to respond to a subpoena which has not happened yet but may sooner than expected as some judges are clearly on to the big stall tactic. But other triggers are completely under Pilosi’s control. She could set the actual impeachment vote for November 15, 2020.

Obviously Nancy can’t talk about this now, but who am I? Just a spectator, not a gladiator. And what a spectacle! This is the greatest show since Watergate, even bigger!

It seems to me that frequency of usage boils down to geography and time of day. Superchargers in urban areas should be capped at the 80% limit for all comers except for the wee hours of the morning when it is odds-on that there is or will be no congestion. Those traveling (not living within) through these urban areas will have many opportunities to recharge elsewhere 60-100 miles away. It may be a bit of a hassle or an inconvenience for them, but we must think of the greater good afforded by this limitation. It only hurts for a little while!
""

Only if there's a supercharger in the right direction. Otherwise, that would just screw people over. Badly.

The right fix is to monitor usage, and for any supercharger that has 100% utilization for more than one hour per day, put it on the list to upgrade to V3 superchargers, ordered by the percentage of time that it is at 100% utilization. Start by adding two V3 stalls, then upgrade the old ones, one stall at a time. Zero downtime, and you fix the real problem, which is that the capacity just can't keep up with demand.

The 80% capping thing doesn't really work. It just punts the problem down the road. If you're only saving 10 minutes on a 1 hour, 10 minute charge, that's only a 14% increase in capacity, and that's the best case, because it assumes that it doesn't cause somebody to use a supercharger that he/she wouldn't otherwise have used before reaching home or a destination charger or whatever. In many cases, it could be almost exactly a no-op, and if they fully charge at that extra supercharging stop, it could even make things worse.

But even if we assume that best-case improvement, a 14% improvement at some of the worst superchargers, such as Mountain View or Sunnyvale, would only mean 1–3 cars in line instead of 3–5 cars in line. Right now. And within a couple of months, enough new cars will have been added to make those improvements evaporate.

No, these supercharging stations need to have more stalls, and be fully upgraded to V3. Anything short of that is just adding a new coat of paint while the barn is on fire.",,0,0,0,0

Wat kan je zeggen mbt de afschrijving van een Tesla ten opzichte van een ‘oudewetse’ auto?
""

Lijkt me momenteel heel lastig te voorspellen. Als het goed is lease je de auto voor 60 maanden. Wat hij dan nog waard is over 60 maanden? Zeg het maar, geen idee. Ik heb zelf als ZZP-er ook financial lease gedaan en gekozen voor een lage slottermijn. Daardoor wordt het maandbedrag wel wat hoger, maar kom je aan het eind van de looptijd niet voor verassingen te staan.

Thuis kan ik niet laden. Ik woon 4-hoog en de gemeente plaatst geen laadpaal op de parkeerplaats. In hoeverre zou je mij een Tesla adviseren als je alleen openbaar kan laden?
""

Ik denk dat dit vooral afhangt van het aantal kilometers dat je verwacht te rijden en hoe prettig of vervelend je het gaat vinden om steeds weer openbaar te moeten laden. Is er wellicht een oplaadpunt bij je in de wijk/ in de buurt?

Voor mij ligt de meerwaarde van een elektrische auto zoals de Tesla ook vooral in het feit dat je 's ochtends altijd een volle (90%) lading hebt, dat de brandstofkosten laag zijn en dat je de auto op afstand kan verwarmen en verkoelen. Lijkt me geen pretje in de winter als Tesla onder de sneeuw zit en je de accu moet gaan gebruiken (met een beperkte range in jouw versie) om de auto sneeuw- en vorstvrij te maken. 

Als ik niet voor de deur zou kunnen opladen, dan zou ik echt serieus overwegen of een elektrische auto wel echt prettig en handig voor je is. Misschien zijn er nog anderen op dit forum die vanuit de positie iets kunnen toevoegen.",,0,0,0,0

I noticed that Troy increased his Q2 total deliveries estimate to 76k from 74k, but he is still much lower than 90k. I know he has missed on some of his estimates, but he has been pretty close in general. I sure hope he is way off this time. The market won't be impressed with deliveries under 80k, particularly with current guidance of 90-100k. Tesla really needs to regain some credibility with respect to guidance. Anything under 90k will obviously be framed as a miss by analysts/media, but IMO if it's a small miss it can be a win. Missing guidance by over 10% would reinforce the disconnect between guidance and execution.

The performance rear calipers are 4-piston brembos.

Originally all Tesla’s had these 4-piston rear calipers but sometime around the front end refresh (circa 2016), Tesla started shipping non Performance models with single piston rears with integrated e-brakes (most likely to save on costs). However they kept the 4-pistons on the Performance models even to this day.

Ik heb ook wel eens een collega met een benzine auto gehad. Boordcomputer gaf nog 20 km aan en naar werk was 15 km. Pakt de koude auto en gaat de rijksweg op. Gemiddeld verbruik aanzienlijk hoger dan de voorgaande 100 km........ Gelukkig had ik nog een sleepkabel in de kofferbak

Sterker nog een benzine of diesel moet je helemaal niet leegrijden en is slecht voor de auto zelf. Toen ik nog in een dino auto reed probeerde ik bij 1/3 al te tanken. 

Volgens de VVD moeten Automobilisten die met een lege tank of accu langs de snelweg staan, worden getrakteerd op een torenhoge boete van 1500 euro. In NL is nog geen wet hiervoor, maar iedereen komt ze regelmatig tegen op de snelweg. Zorgt ook nog voor gevaarlijke situaties.

Ik wilde voor jullie veiligheid even mijn Reddit draadje delen die voor nogal wat interesse en reacties heeft gezorgd.

PSA: Emergency Lane Departure Avoidance has steered me into oncoming traffic multiple times since 2019.16.2. : teslamotors

Emergency Lane Departure Avoidance kan niet permanent uitgeschakeld worden vanaf 2019.16.x. het gaat weer aan bij iedere rit. Niet te verwarren met de normale Lane Departure Warning, deze kan wel uitgeschakeld worden.

Op bepaalde wegen waar geen middenlijn staat maar wel smalle zijstroken, moet ik halverwege in de zijstroken rijden om tegenliggers te laten passeren. Ik heb nu drie keer gehad dan de auto zelf ingrijpt en mij terug naar het midden van de weg stuurt. Hier heb ik nu al twee keer tegenliggers gehad. Ik kan dan ingrijpen, en dat doe ik ook, maar mijn vrouw overcorrigeerde bijna door de schrik. Zonder ingrijpen zou er een botsing zijn geweest.

Ik heb Tesla geïnformeerd maar krijg geen reactie terug, terwijl ik me echt onveilig voel. Hebben jullie hier ook last van? Het lijkt alsof deze functie, die dus niet permanent uit kan en ook zonder Autopilot actief is, niet in Nederland en andere landen is getest.

In het filmpje is de stuurbeweging lastig te zien, ik ga kijken of ik dit kan filmen vanuit de auto zelf met een andere camera.

Die Amerikanen op Reddit snappen onze wegen niet echt, en een aantal vonden dat ik richtingaanwijzers moet gebruiken om op die wegen te rijden...

Als je dit ook ervaart, stuur alsjeblieft een email met details, filmpjes naar Tesla. Hopelijk wordt dit snel opgelost, of krijg ik de mogelijkheid dit permanent uit te schakelen want nu vergeet ik dat... Het is erg lastig jezelf aan te leren 5 stappen te volgen om een veiligheidsfunctie uit te schakelen als je wil wegrijden.

Hier nog het filmpje, de stuurbeweging richting tegenliggers is op ongeveer 4s te zien.

They claim they are supply limited but then why do they keep taking orders for cars if they have no supply? Makes no sense.
""

It's not a mystery, Tesla is cell supply limited, but:

Their demand is geographically diverse and there can be always be over or under-supply of units in a geographical region, especially if the end of quarter is within ~30 days, which is shorter than what it takes to build and ship cars to customers in China.
There's absolutely no reason to lose sales to a hypothetical, non-existent $29,999 Chinese Model 3 being rumored on Chinese social media by trolls for months, and by bringing pricing and availability clarity that it's going to cost $47,000 in 6-10 months they are making it easier for Chinese customers to plan (or execute) their next Tesla purchase. This is a common-sense business practice.

But even for customers where neither factor plays a role it's good for Tesla to up-sell customers to higher spec cars, because they generate more revenue and more margin.
So yes, managing demand makes a lot of sense even if you are supply limited, and these reasons were outlined here on TMC in detail before Tesla made the announcement yesterday.",,0,0,0,0

3707593,"Wanted, 40A 14-50 home charger @ reasonable price",IraB,2019-05-31 00:27:00,"As promised, I purchased a 40A OpenEVSE charger kit and I am now providing a brief initial review. It was on sale when I ordered it. The total cost, including free shipping, with a 14-50 plug was $407. I believe this is the least expensive 40A charger available other than the off-brand models from China. I ordered the kit Thursday last week and it arrived by US Postal Service on Tuesday this week. 

It took me about 2 hours to assemble the kit. The instructions are not the best as in several cases they rely on photos that are not as clear as necessary (either printed out or on my monitor). Based on this, I found myself double and triple checking wiring which slowed things down quite a bit. In addition, one of the wires in the cable that goes to the car is not used, but the directions do not explicitly mention this. Rather, the other wires are all mentioned, but the unused wire is ignored by the instructions. I took quite a bit of time studying the instructions to ensure that I had not missed directions for this wire.

At first the unit did not work after I finished assembling it. I reviewed the FAQ at openevse.com and it suggested several possible issues, including reversed wires between the control module and the display module. That was the problem in my case. Once I connected the wires correctly, everything worked properly.

I like the web / wifi interface. It provides useful data and allows setting options like charge amperage easily. I also like charging at 40A versus 32A that the Tesla portable charger provides. Using the J1772 adaptor has not been a problem. My Model 3 Performance reported charging at a rate of 29 MPH with the Tesla charger. It now reports charging at a rate of 36 MPH with the OpenEVSE charger. The included charging cable is longer than the Tesla cable which is convenient as the Tesla cable barely reached my charge port. Also, despite carrying more current, the OpenEVSE cable is just a flexible and easy to maneuver as the Tesla cable.

At this point, I am highly satisfied with the OpenEVSE device. At full price and fully assembled, it may not be competitive with the Tesla Wall Charger since they are roughly equal in price, with the wall charger providing 48A. However, in kit form at about $400, I am very happy with the OpenEVSE. If I did not already have a 14-50 socket and associated breaker installed, I might have chosen the wall charger since I imagine installation would have been about the same price as installing the 14-50 socket and breaker. There is one additional benefit of the OpenEVSE charger. It is not proprietary and can charge any EV. Thus, if I purchase a non-Tesla EV in the future, I can still use this charger.

So, other than some frustrating assembly instructions, I give the OpenEVSE charger a full thumbs up.

You guys didn't seem to understand my point. I never suggested that Tesla reduce the maximum power of the Roadster. For those of you who must have (and will pay for) a 1.9 second sports coupe, a Tesla Roadster could be the ideal choice. However, I am suggesting there's a HUGE untapped market for an affordable yet still-very-fast Tesla coupe based on the Roadster sheet metal, combined with the Model 3 Performance drivetrain. Take if from Ford's perspective: While they will certainly sell a number of Mustang GT500s with a 700+HP V-8, at the end of the year, over 80% of their sales will probably have been of the 300 HP V-6 version. There is no possible reason why Ford would walk away from 80% of their Mustang sales, and the same goes for Tesla. And remember, the Model 3 Performance is far, far from a slow car -- it's just not as insane.
""

The Ford mustang has been riding the coattails of it's glory days of the American Muscle era, in my opinion. People buy the top of the line Mustangs due to the history, not the performance (because Ford). The car started out as an middling power vehicle, then slowly expanded in both directions until the High performance was joined with the entry level, because Ford is about mass production, first and foremost. 

I think it's better to compare Tesla's Roadster to the La Ferrari, not the Mustang. You don't neuter La Ferrari.

Now, that being said, I agree with you in that there is a market for a quick, but not terrifying 2-door coupe. I, personally, have 0% reason to buy a 4 door vehicle, and would prefer a two door so I can conveniently not have a reason to fit more than one other adult in my car. I've never owned a 4 door over my entire span of 8 vehicles through the years, and I know there are others out there who would be the same or similar. 

I just don't think the Roadster is the model to accomplish this.

Now, what if they came out with a model I, C, the I being a 2 door coupe for economic slow people, and C being ""I am Rich but not Roadster Rich"" 2 door coup?

Then we can have the line up: S 3 X Y P I C.

If a relatively large segment of the US population are calling for impeachment right about the time that Republicans up for reelection have to campaign, it will put them in a bind and make it more politically treacherous for all Republicans in the Senate up for reelection, including McConnell.

The House is moving slowly right now because the courts want to see all reasonable remedies taken before people are held in contempt of Congress. They are burning up the administration's arguments in the courts and the judges are making broad rulings. Once the deadlines set by the courts pass, the House can move to harsher measures. 

We could see Barr and Minuchin locked up until Jan 2, 2021 and it can be in any federal prison or jail the House wants to throw them. Inherent contempt hasn't been used for almost 100 years, but its purely a Congressional thing and outside the courts and the executive branch. The House just wants to be careful to ensure that in the future vindictive Republicans don't start locking up Democrats serving a Democratic president on whims. They need to make sure the cases for contempt are big and all other options are used up first. That's probably why Barr isn't in a prison cell right now. Pelosi knows the Republicans will be gunning for revenge in the future.",,0,0,0,0

Beste mensen,

Ik ben zzp’er en overweeg om zakelijk een Model 3 Standard Range Plus aan te schaffen. Kunnen jullie mij helpen met jullie ervaringen en antwoord geven op mijn vragen?

Thuis kan ik niet laden. Ik woon 4-hoog en de gemeente plaatst geen laadpaal op de parkeerplaats. In hoeverre zou je mij een Tesla adviseren als je alleen openbaar kan laden?

Dit zou voor mij de eerste keer zijn dat ik een gloednieuwe auto ga aanschaffen. Eerder kocht ik alleen occasions. Wat kan je zeggen mbt de afschrijving van een Tesla ten opzichte van een ‘oudewetse’ auto?

En laatste vraag: ik zou de auto contant helemaal kunnen aanschaffen. Zou je dan financial lease adviseren of meteen alles zelf betalen?

Dank jullie wel voor de hulp

Upgrade their order to a P3D (minus the cosmetic upgrades) and pay the difference.
The downside of option 2 is that anybody who ordered before the FSD price increase will have to pay the new higher price for that as well. The upgrade price I was quoted for my LR AWD with FSD is £2,440.

It was a 2 month old car that has spent almost a month at their service center. I am considering legal action since the local service manager said my vehicle doesn't qualify for a buy back but wouldn't elaborate.

Hard to believe neither Model S nor Model X breaches the 2100 sales threshold to be in the top 20, Model S with 2005 sales and Model X with 1858.

I think this was to be expected. Until the arrival of the Model 3, the Model S and X were the only real long-range BEVs available and many people were willing to stretch in order to be able to afford one, even if those models were both too expensive really as well as far too large for what most people need in everyday driving (and parking) over here.

Now the Model 3 offers comparable range plus Tesla tech at much more affordable prices and in a ""European-road-friendly"" package.
I don't think Model S or X sales will pick up again over here, at least not until some significant refresh arrives.

Yes, pictures!

How is the quality of the black panel behind the Tesla logo? That is what seems to look flimsier in some pics.

Also, what is their solution for battery jumpstart? Unplugged mentions it on their site, but T-Sportline does not say anything.

Doing back of the envelope numbers, it looks like the TS upgrade would be just a tad more expensive than fixing at the SC (about 4K, all in).
""

The front piece that snaps around the tub provides some support for the black panel area around the T.

I don't know their solution for jump start but I can tell you mine. I spliced two wires onto the emergency opener inside the frunk. there is already a small hole exiting the frunk under the switch. I then ran the wires (leaving a little long) to the tow hook cover and 2 sided taped it to the back of the cover so upon removal of the cover it can than be pulled out a little to touch a 9 volt transistor battery that will pop the hood.

The jump posts can be accessed by removing the 2 side covers and lastly the front cover that are snapped around the frunk tub. Jumper cables will slip in behind the facelift under the front cover that was unsnapped and placed out of the way.

I got a 3rd hand T-Sportline for $1,000 from TMC member. I would normally have painted myself but still trying to recover from open heart surgery. My hood needed paint because of stone chips and the new facelift and cost $788 for those. Then I had clear wrap installed on lower hood and facelift for $700. So a tally of $2,488.",,0,0,0,0

Oddly Australia only allows you to order M3SR+ and M3P. No LR options, no white interior and no 19"" sport wheels. Similar for other countries listed but some also exclude M3P, eg Hong Kong!
""

To be specific, Australia, Ireland, Japan, and New Zealand are SR+ and P only, Hong Kong and Macau are SR+ only.

...hypothesis: with the exception of Australia, these are pretty small regions, so maybe they're just not focusing on range? Additionally, Supercharger coverage on the main island of Japan and in New Zealand looks pretty good, Macau is absolutely tiny, Hong Kong is quite small and is covered in Superchargers, leaving Australia (which looks to have decent coverage on the populated east coast, but outside of one (1) Supercharger in Western Australia, nothing else) and Ireland (which could use some more).

I suspect sales will not be a problem at all in Hong Kong and Macau.

I'd guess that New Zealand would be fine as well.

Australia... the question is really, how often do people think they'll cross the Outback? That's currently impossible in a Tesla.

As I understand home charging concerns have slowed EV adoption in Ireland, but they like sedans unlike most of Europe, so the body style won't turn people off.

And then there's Japan. I'd guess that they'd need the CHAdeMO adapter that's been discussed recently, and I'm not sure how well a car that big will sell... and there's all sorts of political issues wrapped up in it as well. I'm curious how well the Model 3 does, really.",,0,0,0,0

Means they're all hard-coded, no microcode layer slowing things down. Only 3 bits needed to specify the instruction (though I bet they use 4). It's a really nice chip.
""

Yeah, so the microcode layer is not slowing things down in modern CPUs, even if they have a complex instruction set - the overwhelming majority of instructions is hard-coded there as well, with microcode only executing system level functionality or obsolete instructions these days. It's not an intermediate layer anymore, but an exception mechanism with very little direct cost.

But your conclusion is correct: Tesla has a huge chip design advantage by using just 8 instructions.

This advantage that Tesla has with its extremely simplified instruction set can be best understood by looking at an older CPU architecture from ~15 years ago where the internal die layout is known already:



(Current CPUs will have a similar execution architecture but much larger caches - and there are no public annotated die diagrams.)

The important takeaway from that annotated image of the Intel CPU die is the part marked ""Integer Execution Core"" and ""FP, MMX, SSE2"" block marked right above it, in the center of the chip.

Those two central areas are the REAL CPU that calculate things and make programs progress. All the other bits: the ""Execution Pipeline Start"", ""Instruction Trace Cache"", ""Address Predict"", ""Instruction Decoder"", ""Branch Prediction"", ""Buffer Allocation & Register Rename"" areas are a consequence of trying to make a historically complex and poorly designed instruction set go fast, and these complications are entirely missing from Tesla's chip.

This is one of the little understood reasons why Tesla's chip is such a huge deal and break-through, even compared to GPU's which have simpler instructions set than Intel's x86 instruction set: Tesla uses a very narrow, simplified, hard-coded set of instructions directly mapped to very simple and single-purpose functional units with few dependencies and a minimum number of input parameters, and they don't use a superscalar architecture.

(BTW., side note: I think if they have 8 instructions then Tesla encodes them in 3 bits, not 4 bits, due to another advantage Tesla has: no legacies, no compatibility to keep. They are their own only customers, and they can modify the compiler trivially if there's a new hardware variant with a new instruction format. Why waste even a single bit on future-proofing something that doesn't require future-proofing?)

TL;DR: this gives Tesla both a die utilization advantage (they can use a billion transistors/gates for real computation, not to handle a complicated instruction set), but also gives them a very significant power consumption advantage, which directly transforms into more performance: the power budget is actually the main performance constraint on modern desktop CPUs for example.",,0,0,0,0

I’m not torn, I’m waiting! LR RWD or AWD, white interior. I’m not going to spend $80k+ on something that is not what I want. I’d just end up feeling regret when what I want becomes available.

But this is pretty weird, isn’t it? Why would Tesla not offer the other variants from the get-go? Why not offer white interior? RHD seats are the same as LHD seats, so what gives?  It’s all rather odd, isn’t it?",,0,0,0,0

I'm sure it's easy to get used to. I sat in a 3 in a show room multiple times (this was before they were giving test drives) and really wanted to make it work, as the 3 was the perfect size for me and the price was more in line with what I typically pay for cars. And early reviews from former MS owners said it was an easy transition. But in the end, it reminded me too much of the screens sticking up out of the dash of equivalent BMW, Audi, and MB ICE vehicles, which I always felt were tacked on as afterthoughts. I almost cried when they first revealed the dash on the 3 - ""oh no - they are copying the Germans but on overdrive!"" 

So yeah a lot of my reaction is just aesthetics. But your dash is the thing you spend all your time seeing while you drive.

By not integrating the screen into the dash and ditching the IC, Tesla was able to drop the height of the dash a significant amount. This made road visibility far superior than in the S or X. That fact alone makes the Model 3 style dash worth it.",,0,0,0,0

Will they send me a bill at home or will I have to settle the CC directly in London?

I have also found EPC plc for ULEZ registration, and successfully registered at their website, added my car and got approved.
Will this cover me also for the CC ?

I am not familiar with EPC. I am fairly certain that you have to register for the CC discount directly with TFL.

On the TFL website, can you select the option to enter the address manually? This allows you to select the country and then fill in all the other address fields manually.

If you don't register for a discount or pay the CC charge, TFL will send you a fine. (Annoyingly, they will use ANPR cameras to read your number plate and look up the same information that they expect you to provide with the £10 registration i.e. they don't really need anyone to register for a discount, they already know whether your vehicle qualifies for a discount.)

Ik weet nog goed dat de meeste 2013/2014 Tesla rijders ZZP ITers waren. Dus met de volledige MIA/KIA/VAMIL (Mia ook in 2014 volledig als je in 2013 de verplichting aanging) 2013 leveringen op 0%, Tesla verzekering voor vaste prijs, ongeveer €750, gratis laden. Met een inkomstenbelasting van 52% was je netto aanschaf bedrag ongeveer gelijk aan een luxe Golf of standaard Audi A4. Met dan ook nog eens zo een 60k aan kilometers per jaar voornamelijk op de SuC en de gratis bakjes koffie terwijl je aan het laden was werden de KM uiteraard vol gedeclareerd bij de opdrachtgevers.

Nu is het heel anders, Tesla zal zich nu echt op de luxe rijders moeten gaan richten waar de slag zal worden moeten geslagen door een veel langere range, hoge laadsnelheden, zowel AC als DC en een fantastisch laadnetwerk. Wat ik zo kan opmaken uit de berichtgeving zal er vanaf september/oktober echt een geheel ge-update S/X lijn komen (is hier al aangegeven), met inderdaad minimalistische interieur zoals de M3 maar ze zullen denk ik echt met veel wijzigingen gaan komen. Denk zeker hogere kwaliteit zittingen en betere afwerking. De accu en laadtechniek zal dezelfde als de M3 gaan zijn maar dan een 120(+) kWh accu en ook dezelfde laadpoort CCS zonder adapter dus en dat voor onder de €100.000. Ook denk ik dat ze meer op de X zullen gokken dan op de S, misschien zelfs wel zonde vleugeldeuren. Waar de M3/Y is nu al duidelijk de concurrentie aan het voeren is met bijvoorbeeld Volkswagen is dat voor de nieuwe S/X de dikkere Audi/Mercedes rijders dus, daar gaan ze zich vol op richten. Diegene die een EV audi/Merc en toch ook wel Jaguar iPace kopen komen nu erachter dat ze in een luxe auto rijden maar veel ongemak ondervinden met laden, range etc. Dit is publiek dat het niet boeit om wat meer te betalen voor laden, bijtelling zijn ze gewent om 22/25% te betalen over een bak van een ton dus gaan ze alleen maar op vooruit hiermee, gaat echt niet omrijden om goedkoop te kunnen laden, tijd=geld dus liefst 750+ KM in de accu en thuisladen of op de zaak. Op vakantie ermee 1x laden tijdens de lunch etc. En dan is NL een klein land, als je in Duitsland straks 280 kan gaan en dan 500 km doortrappen op één lading, alle Mercs, Porches en Audi's zoektrekt denk ik zo maar dat Duitslang de nieuwe nr1 in Europa zal worden qua Tesla uitleveringen, in ieder geval de S/X.",,0,0,0,0

Beste mensen,

Ik ben zzp’er en overweeg om zakelijk een Model 3 Standard Range Plus aan te schaffen. Kunnen jullie mij helpen met jullie ervaringen en antwoord geven op mijn vragen?

Thuis kan ik niet laden. Ik woon 4-hoog en de gemeente plaatst geen laadpaal op de parkeerplaats. In hoeverre zou je mij een Tesla adviseren als je alleen openbaar kan laden?

Dit zou voor mij de eerste keer zijn dat ik een gloednieuwe auto ga aanschaffen. Eerder kocht ik alleen occasions. Wat kan je zeggen mbt de afschrijving van een Tesla ten opzichte van een ‘oudewetse’ auto?

En laatste vraag: ik zou de auto contant helemaal kunnen aanschaffen. Zou je dan financial lease adviseren of meteen alles zelf betalen?

Dank jullie wel voor de hulp 
""

Naast thuisladen is er ook overdag laden als je aan het werk bent. Zou een mogelijkheid kunnen zijn. Iets voor jou om te checken. Genoeg gratis apps waarmee je laadpalen kan ontdekken.

Afschrijving van een Model 3 zal mi laag zijn relatief gezien. Over 5 jaar zal de vraag naar gebruikte Model 3’s hoog zijn en het aanbod nog steeds beperkt. Onze MS is verkocht voor ruim 40% van de nieuwwaarde na 5 jaar 140.000 km. Dat is in die klasse echt bijzonder veel. Ik verwacht dat de Model 3 misschien nog wel minder af zal schrijven. 

Aangezien je weinig thuis kan laden zou ik de LR RWD wel aanraden. Ook als gebruikte Tesla lijkt mij dat een gewilde optie en het geeft je meer armslag. Per maand scheelt het in de lease iets van 50 euro lijkt mij. 

Zelf zou ik als ondernemer voor lease kiezen en cash overhouden om te ondernemen. Als het goed is haal je dan meer rendement dan je aan rente betaalt. 

Vwb verbruik: normverbruik van de Model 3 is prima haalbaar buiten de snelwegen. Op snelweg ga je snel op hogere waarden uitkomen. Eea erg afhankelijk van hoe je rijdt. Moest het nodig zijn is normverbruik halen in de meeste gevallen wel mogelijk.

In de winter is het verbruik hoger, maar met regen is het nog hoger. Buitentemperatuur doet meer met korte ritten dan lange ritten. Niet teveel over inzitten. De MS85 had een vergelijkbare range met de SR+. Nooit echt last van gehad.

Kortom: even jouw eigen situatie bekijken met laadmogelijkheden. Lijkt mij sterk dat daar geen mouw aan te passen valt.",,0,0,0,0

It was a 2 month old car that has spent almost a month at their service center. I am considering legal action since the local service manager said my vehicle doesn't qualify for a buy back but wouldn't elaborate. I am insisting on a replacement car since I cannot trust that there wasn't more damage than they have told me (they initially said there was no body damage, only a broken window, yet they had to take it to the body shop twice). Please help.

There is no excuse for lying. Having said that, mistakes happen and have to be dealt with. If the repairs were done so you can’t even tell anything was wrong, then take the car and enjoy it.

That's true, but in reality the GPU's real instruction set has to properly support the superset of all the capabilities and data format that these very large 3D APIs define, and if an older but still popular game benchmarks poorly on a new video card then that video card is not going to sell as well.

There's subtle differences, idiosyncrasies, patent traps and other complications that make 'legacy' and 'compatibility' a real issue for GPU design as well.

Especially CUDA complicates GPU design: it's a very flexible programming environment that allows the running of almost arbitrary programs on GPUs - but 'very flexible' means there's a lot of different workloads running on GPU clusters: simulations, data analysis, rendering, neural net training, etc. Their design has to meet those varied and generic workloads, because it's being run by their paying customers.

Tesla's only paying customer is running neural net inference computing using minifloats. That's a very, very big design and performance advantage.",,0,0,0,0

Just spoke to Tesla sales. They don't have any official information yet, but they expect that people who've already ordered an LR AWD will be given two options:

Take delivery of their LR AWD as ordered, potentially with a small discount to account for the price drop in the P3D.
Upgrade their order to a P3D (minus the cosmetic upgrades) and pay the difference.
The downside of option 2 is that anybody who ordered before the FSD price increase will have to pay the new higher price for that as well. The upgrade price I was quoted for my LR AWD with FSD is £2,440.

Bit disappointed about the prospect of paying more for FSD, but they say they expect more solid information in the next few days.

I'm in the military, and I was stationed in Yokosuka, Japan back in 2010-2013. I would love, love to go back as my next duty station, BUT I am also planning on getting a Tesla as my next vehicle. If I were to get orders to Japan, they'd be for 2 or 3 years, and I would not want to wait that much longer before converting to Tesla. 

So, I'd either be importing a Tesla to Japan from the States (my forever vehicle), or I'd be purchasing one while there, and then selling it when I leave. Since it wouldn't be my forever car, I'd likely get a basic Model S because expensive. 

But I don't speak Japanese to search the used car market in Japan, and Tesla Japan keeps kicking me out of the Japan used car section. I am unable to view any selection they have, which is strange.

What are the average prices there? Does that amount include the Taxes? Speaking of, how is road tax for an Electric vehicle?

Wow this is a 10+ year-old thread of Hydrogen vs. Battery!

Does anyone on this thread think a Toyota hybrid with 100 miles of EV range(probably with Toyota's solid state battery), plus 500+ miles of Hydrogen range, a viable combo or not?

Viable in the sense that it bypasses the need of frequent fill-ups, and yet provides the range for long trips?

Hyundai, Honda, Toyota all have HFCVs, these 3 have the deep pockets to bet on all fronts, while Tesla can only bet on one.
""

With a hydrogen filling infrastructure, it'd work. But I don't think it'll ever happen.

Keep in mind, every single fuel cell car out there has had a battery pack - the response time of the fuel cell to throttle inputs isn't adequate for traffic, so they are all mild hybrids.

The largest cost in a FCEV by far is the fuel cell stack, with its precious metal catalysts. I think the Clarity 100 kW stack was nearly a million, though they've gotten cheaper since.

So the manufacturers have to have known for decades that they could greatly reduce the costs by going with a Volt or i3 approach - building a battery to handle all acceleration and making the fuel cell stack just big enough to handle freeway travel.

Something asking the lines you suggest would be cheaper to build, lighter, and much more practical than any FCEV to date (though 100 EV miles is excessive for a PHEV. 40-50 covers the vast majority of trips and gives a smaller, lighter, cheaper package.)

Despite that, I'm only aware of one concept PHFCEV. I believe the reason for this is the motives of the folks who offer FCEVs.

Allowing you to charge at home for 90% of your travel breaks the oil company supply paradigm. It's a lot harder to justify hydrogen filling stations if they are almost never used.

It is unlikely that hydrogen will ever be as cheap to run on as electricity, and the current trends in battery and fuel cell pricing make it unlikely that the fuel cell car could be enough cheaper to produce to offset the difference in running costs.

Hydrogen cars inherently have additional wear items, failure modes, and safety risks as well - and at the moment they have mandatory retirement ages based on the need to certify and replace the high pressure side of the storage system after a number of pressure cycles.

So in principle it's a better solution than an FCEV, but I don't actually think it's a great solution for our roads today - and I do think the fact that it isn't being proposed says a lot about the folks that do propose FCEVs.",,0,0,0,0

Ive been researching model 3s for a while and finally placed an order for a black lr awd a few hours ago. I noticed on the est. fees due at time of pickup is about 10k... that seems rather wild and I havent read any mentions of this online.

Im under the impression i owe 5k at time of pickup (2500 down, 2500 at pickup). 

Are taxes and fees also due at the same time or will those fees be rolled into the loan? I am accustomed to the fees being rolled into the monthly payments. I think this may still be the case because when i was going through the info entry, it stated the cars monthly payment was lower by about $33 than i anticipated - 727 vs 760 - would this explain the discrepancy in pricing?

Needless to say I hurried up and placed an order for an SR+ with FSD. With the stock price down, and having just placed an order for a very expensive (for me) car, I’m feeling poor. I had planned to finance some of the Model 3 by selling some TSLA, but I really don’t want to sell right now.

Just checked - UK & Australia pages are the same - except the tow hitch available in the UK.

So it seems that there are no white interior RHD at all yet - and likely only two types rolling off the production lines - SR + & Performance.

I can understand ramping up slowly - I just thought they'd go for Performance & LR (which i wanted) first.

Did you even see the video I linked? I'm referring to the AEB that will bring the car to dead stop, not up to 25mph.

That subaru will brake to dead stop if there is car in front of it. I have a SR+, I don't think my car will do that....yet with manual driving. It will still crash the car in front of me.

If I'm on a stop and go traffic in a city and i don't do more than 25mph, this automatic brake feature in tesla you mentioned won't saves me from fender bender. We need Tesla to upgrade the AEB features on our model 3 so that at least we have one less thing to worry about (especially let your wife, son, significant others or your incompetent friends driving your car, and somehow they forget what's the difference between brake and gas pedal on the last minutes)
""

Did you read your owners manual? Because Tesla’s AEB feature does operate as long as the vehicle travels over 7mph (and below 90). What happens under that 25mph threshold (does it stop completely?) I have no idea. But I do agree that the circumstances you mentioned (ex. pressing the accelerator) would cause an accident. That’s where Suburu has a one up, as it apparently cuts the throttle.

That being said, none of these systems are entirely reliable. “No car in our test could avoid a collision beyond 30 mph, and as we neared that upper limit, the Tesla and the Subaru provided no warning or braking.” (Source). However I question the validity of their tests because it looks like they’re using a cardboard/foam model car and I don’t think any car’s AEB can reliably pick that up consistently.",,0,0,0,0

My two cars almost always charge at the same time on a 14-50 / Clipper Creek setup (there would be no difference with two 14-50s). At the very least there is an overlap (one may start before the other, but there is always some time (minutes or hours) when both are charging at the same time.

There is no adapter for the Tesla side, There is always an adapter for the wall side (regardless of what type of receptacle you are plugging into) but in practice you never remove the adapter, so it's just as convenient.

What the HPWC offers is potentially a faster charge (depends on the car and battery size), a longer cable, and a hardwired connection. Also the HPWC can be installed outdoors. If none of those items are important to you, then the UMC/14-50 is the cost effective way to go.

Well, on an individual level, yes, it would still be just as seamless, because you can leave your mobile charge cable plugged in permanently at home and coiled on a hook on the wall. I and many others have been going that way for years. You just grab it from the wall and plug it in, so it's the same as a wall connector.

This 8 lane supercharger is connected to a service center delivering a high volume of cars to New England buyers. On a busy delivery day, a SA told me their delivery goal was 75 /day; hard for me to believe. Every car delivery requires an 80% charge, so clearly service center deliveries are inflating charger usage numbers.

 I can see the road just fine in my S. But, all other things being equal, better visibility is just better.

I don't know that I agree about the center console. You're still changing your focus away from the road, and it's not like I check my speed every 5 seconds. Shifting your gaze a bit to the left seems a bit immaterial. Honestly, a HUD would be ideal. But, absent that, I don't see moving the speedo to the center display being a big issue.

The tint was done by this shop, owner name is Sarkis:

AccutintPro.com
1700 W Foothill Blvd
Ste A
Upland, CA 91786

I took the car back today as he instructed. He saw the bubble inside the car and the white spots, apparently from dust inside the tint.

He said “that’s normal”

I said... I’ve never seen that in my 20 years of getting previous cars tinted... to which he said “sigh.. I’ll take care if it for you “ with a half smile and half annoyance.

I said, do you expect me to just leave it alone? To which he replied with a smug, “I’ll take care of it for you” with a more serious tone this time

I kind of stood there, speechless. 

I was expecting an apology for having to drive back to the shop, take half day off from work just to bring the car back because of THEIR mistake, especially after paying $500 for a tint job.

But no, he just gave me this annoying stare and said “it will be taken care of ...” no apology, no other details , no hint of taking responsibility. He said it won’t take long.
I said how long, he said not long. I said I need to know approx time, he finally said 2-3 hours , lol. I said ok, I need to get back home.

So I now have to pay for Uber to go back home. I asked, “will you cover my Uber ride back home? it’s 15 min from here.”

He replied : “ we will replace the whole rear window tint for you...” this time, with a frown on his face.

I replied and told him I spent $25 on Uber when I brought the car to him the first time. Now, I have to spend an additional $25 on top of taking a day off work.

I said I think it’s fair you cover my Uber.

He frowned more and just said “I’ll take care of everything and walked off into the shop”

I stood there, wondering wtf just happened.

I thought about just taking my car and leaving...then I called an Uber and now I’m on the way home 


Very sour experience , not sure if I should’ve left my car with him, but oh well, sentry mode is ON lol

3707879,Current Quality,RJUK,2019-05-31 04:33:00,"Hi all, first post, so be gentle!

I currently have a Jaguar I-Pace on order because there weren't any lease options available for Model 3's here in the UK a few weeks ago when I was choosing my new car.

However, I can now get a model 3 on lease, so I'm considering changing the order to a Model 3 Performance instead.

That said, whilst I'm aware that the M3P is faster than the I-Pace and has that big cool touch screen and slightly better range, I've seen a lot of people online saying that the Model 3 quality isn't that great. Paint scratches aren't a major issue for me because I have a polisher and could therefore correct them myself (assuming they're not too awful), but things like misaligned panels and off-centre steering wheels etc are more worrying, especially as here in the UK the car will be one of the first here and knowledge will therefore be limited, plus there's only one service centre nearby.

Also, all the options I had added to the I-Pace are simply not available on the Model 3, which is annoying. Common things like privacy glass, just aren't available (and I can't add it because the car is a lease and I don't think work will allow me due to insurance), plus air suspension, head-up display, adaptive matrix headlights, power tailgate etc don't seem to be available on the Model 3.

As such, I'm torn. Part of me wants the M3P because the performance is so good and this infotainment display is so huge and responsive, but on the other side it's lacking on options and quality seems to be a concern.

Another trade off is that it's slightly cheaper than the I-Pace if I don't spec the full autonomous driving, which I think would be the case as the roads I tend to travel don't really lend themselves to autonomous driving and more importantly, who buys a car this quick to have it drive itself?!

I posted a similar thread on the I-Pace forums, and the support was mostly in favour of the I-Pace, as you'd expect, hence my posting here to get an alternative viewpoint.

Advies was om rond 09:00 op woensdag te bellen of de afspraak om 10:30 door gaat. Had liever gehoord dat ze in het Tesla proces zelf wat pro actiever waren geweest en zelf zouden bellen als er wat verstoring zou plaatsvinden.

3707881,Phantom braking will get a lot worse before it gets better,rnortman,2019-05-31 04:33:00,"Kuro68k said:
↑

This is another reason why having more sensors, i.e. lidar, is an advantage. The more sensors the easier it is to identify things which cause phantom braking.
""

There is even a term for this used by the people who know what they're talking about: sensor diversity. Elon may be correct that you don't need lidar, or that ""lidar is a crutch"", but that misses the point. Sensor diversity, even if not strictly required, makes the system perform better in a variety of circumstances.

I'll go ahead and make a counter-argument against myself though. Every sensing type has false positives. If phantom braking is caused by false positives, then more sensing types means more false positives, and therefore more phantom braking.

Counter-counter-argument: If you use the sensor diversity to seek confirmation of one sensor's detection before trusting it, you can reduce false positives.

Counter-counter-counter argument: If you ignore what one sensor is telling you because another sensor doesn't see anything there, it may be just that the other sensor is having a false negative, and there really is something there, and by ignoring it you're going to get a lawsuit and lots of bad press. (e.g., ignoring radar return from the side of a truck because the camera thinks it looks like sky.)

Counter-counter-counter-counter argument: If you have at least three sensing modalities and sophisticated sensor fusion, it becomes increasingly unlikely to have a false negative on two modalities at the same time. (e.g., Lidar+Radar would see that truck and camera would be outvoted.)

The primary issue with mass adoption is your first sentence. That's the view point of just about anyone I've talked to that isn't a diehard Tesla fanboi. When I ask people if they've ever been in one the ones who say ""yes"" usually follow that response up with something along the lines of ""I hated the inside because it was so plain and the screen in the middle looks like someone just glued a tablet on the dash"" which is off-putting to a lot of people. 

Most of these same people don't even realize there are different models of Teslas and that one of them is more of a traditional dash layout like they're used to. They just go on to tell everyone their personal experience with a Tesla.

Much like the ""refresh"" was actually the first design but they added the nose cone to early Model S because focus groups weren't keen on the design they need to keep the Model S/X the way it is currently laid out to have different options. The Model 3/Y appeals to younger people while the Model S/X is more of the older generation car kind of like other manufacturers do with their lower priced models.

Model 3 was all about cutting costs and a second display adds a lot of cost to an otherwise inexpensive car. I personally believe they'll keep the 2nd gauge display for all of the reasons I mentioned above. This idea that they're just going to make every vehicle exactly the same as the Model 3 moving forward is kind of silly.
""

There is some truth to what you say. But on the opposite side of the coin is the group of people that want something cool and different. I think it's a bit like the iPhone/Blackberry keyboard debate. My first reaction was ""no keyboard"" - that's nuts. But in-fact it was prescient.

A lot has to do with Tesla's power as a market leader and trend-setter. If Tesla has enough ""trend-setter appeal"" to make the celebrities and other influencers decide that a simple/spartan interior is the next, cool, modern thing, then that will draw in the younger demographic. And once that happens the entire bandwagon will follow with Tesla at the head of the line.

I'm thinking they might offer both. They have to solve CHAdeMO for the 3 to sell effectively in Japan (the S/X CHAdeMO adapter appeared shortly after the S launched in Japan,) and as you noted, they had to solve CCS to comply with EU rules in Europe.

So with the rumors floating around, I kinda think both adapters might show up late this year or early next year - a version of the dumb adapter used for CCS on the S/X in the EU and charger module retrofits to match, and a version of the smart adapter used for CHAdeMO on the S/X now that's 3 capable.",,0,0,0,0

Interesting, I take it your home loads don't go over 15kW? Are you using the RS232 port on the inverter to control the modes or is it all contactor based?

For 13 kW solar I would go with 15 kW inverter to have some extra room. It has larger transformer and more MOSFETs on control board. When solar production goes over 12 kW and nothing in the house offsets the production (to go below 12 kW) the inverter will shutdown in 20 seconds.

13kW is my absolute peak and it's not maintained for long, their way the house maintains a constant usage of 1-1.5kW so I should be ok.

I suspect the configurator hasn't caught up. The change is due in part to the HMRC instigated VAT changes - basically if the GFV is too low it's not really a PCP as nobody will by the car so it's actually a lease. Chapter and verse here

Also, you may want a second one simply because of where the wall connector is located and the way the cars are parked.

The sequence I suggest is the following. You don't have to start at the first step (my comment above jumps ahead).

1. Install 14-50 outlet on 50amp circuit, using #2 copper wire.
2. Replace 14-50 outlet with wall connector. 
3. Upgrade to larger circuit - replace breaker and adjust wall connector setting.
4. Add second wall connector using same circuit.

How likely having two cars charged at the same time? Is it realistic?

↑

City driving will be much harder than highway driving. Highways are fairly well controlled, everyone moving in the same direction with a divider separating other traffic, no complex junctions, no pedestrians etc.

For example, it will have to handle all kinds of pedestrian crossings, including those without traffic lights and people jay walking. In the UK that requires it to recognize people near the crossing who look like they might be able to use it and slow down well in advance.
""

Thanks for replying to my thread. The fact that city driving is so much harder than highway driving, is precisely what makes it a good test for FSD. And we know that city self-driving has been a very difficult challenge for companies like Waymo and Cruise. So I expect it to a big challenge for Tesla as well. 

In regards to your last point, I agree that self-driving cars should be very careful around pedestrians of course. However, pedestrians do have a responsibility as well to follow the rules and not to jay walk for example. So yes, a self-driving should slow down near crossings when they see pedestrians. But the task of predicting whether a pedestrian is actually going to jay walk or not is a very difficult one. A self-driving car should be safe but it cannot be expected to read minds. Again, I think pedestrians have a responsibility to follow the rules too. This would be true if cars were self-driving or not. 



Saghost said:
↑

Automatic city driving will be by far the hardest test of FSD. I wouldn't say it's the first test.

I expect it to go from doing everything on the highway to handling rural roads with stop signs and red lights to doing city driving.

It sounds like NoA is close to the first part for routine driving already, but it has to start dodging road debris and animals and the like (both discussed in the Autonomy Day presentations.)

So to my mind the first real test of the new NNs will be the somewhat relaxed environment of the back country roads, and once they demonstrate competence there it'll flow progressively into more frantic city centers.
""

Thanks for the reply. Yes, I agree that Automatic City Driving will start with something ""easy"" like local roads and work its way up towards more difficult scenarios like a busy city center. I definitely don't expect Automatic City Driving to be able to handle a busy downtown like Chicago or NYC right out of the gate. But seeing how it handles a more relaxed scenario will indeed be a good test of whether Tesla has the fundamentals down.",,0,0,0,0

Teslas are not boats, or paddleboats. The door seals (and other seals) are meant to prevent water ingress from incidental water contact, not from plowing through 8-inch deep water. No matter what Elon and Tesla may say - and yes, they have tweeted/retweeted various videos recently (over the winter) about this. Which I find to be a strange thing to do (even though they said concurrently that they did not recommend it).

I can't imagine that Teslas are any different than regular cars in this regard, in the sense that if the ICE vehicle is floating and air can get to the engine, you can probably use the wheels as paddles. Though it's possible that there are belts and such that would be negatively impacted in an ICE that don't exist in a Tesla. My point is that in either case it's a disaster and will result in likely irreparable harm to the vehicle.
""

Unless snorkeled, an ICE engine is going to conk out far earlier from water coming through the air intake. You'll definitely be able to get further from shore.

Tesla only selling SR+ and P versions of the Model 3 in RHD markets is a good sign for Model 3 demand IMO.

During the Autonomy Day presentation, Elon said they would favor small battery configurations to maximize the number of cars on the road.

Offering only SR+/P and not LR AWD in RHD markets suggests that Tesla is doing exactly what Elon said they would -- favoring smaller battery cars to get the maximum number of cars on the road. Implicit in this plan is that demand for Model 3 will outstrip cell supply. Otherwise, the logical thing to do would be sell higher margin LR AWD cars.

Even if margins are lower this also should maximize revenue and cash flow since Tesla can sell ~3 SR+ for every 2 LR variants (assuming ~50kWh v. ~75kWh batteries) if it is cell limited.

Together with limited Model 3 inventory availability (the parking lot truthers seem to have crawled back into their holes) and Elon's email last week, the signs point to demand for Model 3 being very strong going into Q3.

If you also factor in the delay from Tesla’s optimistic estimates, there is statistically a very high chance that we’ll only see a handful of deliveries to occur by EOY (for PR purposes).

Rather, I expect Tesla to release Automatic City Driving in Beta by November-December 2019. You are saying ""end of 2020"" because you are thinking of when Automatic City Driving will be completely finished and perfect but Tesla will probably release a Beta version sooner so that they can gather more real world data from the fleet.",,0,0,0,0

Last week, I had the chance to test how quickly the temperature rises in our Model 3 with white interior. I brought the cabin temperature to 72 degrees and then shut off the AC while the car was in full sunlight (80 degree weather) and sitting on black asphalt. In just 6 minutes the cabin got back to 110 degrees and in 10 mins was already at 115. I decided against running the AC to conserve energy while away from the car until the last five minutes of our approach.

Cabin overheat protection is convenient, but from an energy savings perspective it makes more sense to cover your windows or park in the shade. The trouble with these vehicles is the sheer surface area of glass. While driving under intense sun, I can definitely feel the heat in the cabin - especially within a few inches of the upper glass components. I have a tendency to wear a hat while driving which helps a bit.

Ah, this is really nice. It seems the frequency-dependent selection would relate the economists not of economy of scale and experience or learning curves. Specifically the experience curve seems dependent on sufficient opportunities to cut costs as a supply chain scales up. If scale increases do not actually lead to unit cost reductions, then the experience curve wont work. But empirically we see that some technologies or products have faster experiences curves than others. For example, solar has a faster learning rate than wind. (I don't recall specific numbers off the top of my head, but a simple web search should find it quickly.) So there seems to be something inherently different between solar and wind. But this learning rate is very important to understand how wind had reached grid price parity and scaled up sooner, but that solar looks to surpass wind both on low cost and scale. I think it may have something to do with the physical scale differences. Wind turbines get performance gains and lower unit cost mostly by increasing the size of the turbine. But going big makes turbines more difficult and costly to produce and install. Solar, however, realized performance gain by improvements at scales approaching the nanoscale. So I think this has something to do with the differences, but maybe there are frequency-dependent factors at work too.

I just got home from driving on a multi-lane, 40 MPH zone (I don't have Autosteer, TACC, etc.), with 2019.16.2. 

When driving properly in my lane (which is winding, so false positives could be possible), no interference. 
When changing lanes with a blinker on (quick blink and long hold), no interference. 
I then attempted twice, once on each side of the car, to drift (over 25 MPH) into the other lane w/o signaling (no cars next to me for a collision). 
Each time as I got very close, maybe over the lines, the steering wheel steered me back into the lane gently. Just like many OEM ICE systems. The car did NOT make noise. The steering was appropriate and expected, not jarring or evasive.

My daily commute is 80km. I don't do any long road trips (max, MTL or Niagara). I charge to 90% daily at home (347km) meaning I can go to work and come back approx. 4 times. Worst case (winter), assume 50% battery capacity (193km), I'm still looking at ~2.5 round trips daily.

For the 15k difference, IMO it's not worth the LR.

There's a divergence in understanding here.

To me, Tesla would die if it runs out of cash.

But for the past 16 years, Tesla had many times that it was at the brink of running out of cash but cash infusion has always been replenished at crucial times.

Cash infusion has happened in the past, it has happened just now, and I will expect it to happen in a foreseeable future.

In summary, no: Tesla does not have to make profit in order to thrive.
""

There we have it. Either a total denial of the facts or a total misunderstanding of the nature of Tesla. You don't seem to realize that at some point the ""start up"" has to mature into a butterfly. 

If Tesla doesn't need to make a profit, why do they seem to be so eager to announce that they will be returning to profitability this year? That is what every fiber of the company is straining to achieve. 




Is it about running out of cash in 10 months? That's internal communications, not public materials.

10 months is a long time to run out of cash for a growth company like Tesla by the way!

That's what the fresh capital is for, to allow them to float another year or so if they continue to make little or no profit. 





Stock goes up and stock goes down.

People who enjoy roller coaster has no problem with that, otherwise, please just find somewhere flat.



Traditionally, company needs to produce profits to prove it is worth of its value.

But nowadays, many investors prefer to see growth as the value and are willing to skip over profits.

The trouble is a company like Tesla has to mature. If they wanted to remain in a high growth stage without making profits, they could have done that and planned for it.

What is abhorrent is adults on this forum voluntarily accepting a car with known cosmetic or mechanical issues and then complaining about the problems after accepting the purchase.

I see you live in Vancouver... when you buy fresh salmon/fish at the market do you ensure it looks and smells right when you ask the attendant to wrap it up? If you found the raw food reeking of ammonia when they hand it to you do you still buy it and complain the next day on how it gave you food poisoning? Or do you tell the attendant thanks but no thanks?

Busted analogy alert!

Fish you can't really fix, it isn't feasible.  Cars generally can be for 'minor' stuff, and some of the major stuff won't be apparent until you drive anyway.

When I picked up it was getting dark, it had rained just a little earlier, and the Service Center was actually closed. One person had stayed behind to hand over cardkey and receive the sealed paperwork package (helloooo Texas). I confirmed it had 4 wheels, 4 doors, and that the charger pack was in the trunk. I literally said, ""yup, its got 4 wheels"". We both knew there was no going over the vehicle to an appropriate level in the dusk quickly going dark, she said ""check at home, call if you find anything"".

Rounded corners was a callback to the Apple UI debates, not a Tesla example. Having used many car user interfaces with dizzying arrays of buttons that require inputs in multiple places within the cockpit, 6 deep menu stacks, arbitrary decision trees and useless choices (Audi anyone?), I find this interface clean, easy and logical to navigate and not distracting. Out of 15 fellow Tesla owners in my area (S&Xs), 10 love Version 9 and 5 haven’t really noticed that it changed. And it has continued to improve (A/C controls for example). I don’t use bitching on a forum as a useful metric of actual problems or dissatisfaction. Sometimes the bitching has a point (identifying that a certain capacitor had a 90 percent failure rate on the circuit board for Mitsubishi’s Diamond series rear projection TVs), many times it does not and is self perpetuating. On something Iike this, though, it is entirely subjective and if you hate it you aren’t wrong subjectively. So if it dismays you that much, buy another car with the same or better functionality and a UI that you prefer, Or give up functionality for a ""better"" UI because that is your key driver. No rancor, just reality. And a car that relies so heavily on software for even the non-smart driving tasks (suspension response, braking, battery charging and cooling and myriad others) is going to need updates. For every idiotic fart mode change that some intern is coding as a project there are a myriad of behind the scenes fixes and improvements. People bitched on forums for 2 years about Directv’s UI change mostly because they had to re-learn ingrained habits in order to use a much superior and function interface. So go get Dish! In any case, no offense intended.

For 'normal' degradation, i.e. not a catastrophic event such as lithium plating, the primary degradation mechanism is SEI growth, which consumes cyclable lithium, consumes active material and increases resistance.

The summary of what you can best do is in the image in the first post on this thread. It is really about keeping temperature as close to 10-20 deg C as possible, not using the absolute extremes of the SoC of the battery and only fast charging when needed.

Will China only produce SR or SR+?

I actually didn’t expect them to lower the price of locally made cars, at least not by much.
So I’m suspecting if the locally made M3 carries lower price, they won’t be exactly the same as SR+, so it won’t mess up pricing in other markets.
Maybe it’ll be something in the middle of SR+ and the original SR, and priced around SR level.

Anyways they probably would stop importing SR+ soon, this pulls up the SR+ demand who prefers imported Tesla.

Again I would expect the price to be not much lower, so people would stop speculating locally cars to be much cheaper. Some could give up the waiting and pull the trigger on imported higher trims.
""

Quoting myself, I think the GF3 M3 pricing makes much sense. It’s roughly the same price as US SRP + VAT. And looks consistent with pricing in other overseas markets.

The price difference between GF3 M3 and imported M3 is exactly the amount of tariff.

This should be able to eliminate unrealistic expectations and help people pull the trigger on imported higher trims.

Someone gave you the wrong information on these, so I'm chiming in. Specifically, I'll use the Tesla 2024 convertibles as an example since this is what I bought. I'll also assume Tesla SP is $190 for the calculations. I'm new to corporate convertible bonds, but not totally new to convertible debt.
CUSIP 88160RAG6
Bonds Detail

The bond component of a convertible is like a normal bond, where it pays interest and pays back the face value at maturity. In the case of 88160RAG6, they're trading just below $90 for $100 face value and pay 2% a year. This means you get paid simple interest of $10 for 5 years plus $10 profit from trading below $100, which is $20 / $90 / 5 = 4.4%.

The bonds also have an option (but not required) to convert to Tesla shares at a minimum ratio of 3.22 per $1000 of bonds. The conversion price is therefore ~$310 a share or lower. You would only convert if the current SP is above the conversion price of course to net an immediate profit.

If Telsa SP is $500 in 2024, you'll make (500 - 310) = $190 / share = $59 / bond. Add the $20 from interest and discounted price today for a profit of $79 per bond, or 87% profit after 5 years.

Doing similar math for convertibles and summarizing 5 years out:
If Tesla SP is $10, profit is 22%
If Tesla SP is $95, profit is 22%
If Tesla SP is $190, profit is 22%
If Tesla SP is $310, profit is 22%
If Tesla SP is $500, profit is 87%
If Tesla SP is $1000, profit is 260%
If Tesla SP is $4000, profit is 1294%

Compare this to to buying shares.
If Tesla SP is $10, profit is -95%
If Tesla SP is $95, profit is -50%
If Tesla SP is $190, profit is 0%
If Tesla SP is $310, profit is 63%
If Tesla SP is $4000, profit is 2000%

I look at it this way, but this is solely my opinion.

1. I'm buying Tesla because it may go up 5x or 10x. If it only goes up 10% annually, I might as well invest in bonds or more conservative stocks. The convertibles ensure a profit except in the most unlikely case (bankruptcy AND assets can't cover debt). Even so, I should get a good chunk back in the worst case.

2. Although convertibles with TSLA SP $4000 nets 1/3 less than buying stock outright, the additional security and profit lets me invest more than double what I would with stocks. In the big win scenario, I'm ahead. And in the lose scenario, I'm ahead.

Some other pluses for convertibles:
1. There's cases where the conversion ratio increases (share price is cheaper) if Tesla has a change of control (bought out) for around $250 and higher. This adds extra profit in the event things don't work out.
2. Conversion is possible anytime if SP stays above ~30% + conversion price for awhile.
3. Bond holders may even come out whole or mostly whole in the event of bankruptcy, assuming Tesla assets are worth a decent amount.
4. Convertible bonds can be sold and bought like stocks, but goes down about half the rate of TSLA stock when it falls.

Disadvantages:
1. The spread for convertibles ranges from 1-4 points, so it's much higher than stocks, but generally better than options.
""

Wonderful post, thanks so much!

I have never traded in convertible bonds but have been aware of them. Seems I should think seriously about this.

I have to say, that stock sale proceeds moving into Tesla convertible bonds has to add downward pressure on the stock price as I see it. This would be part of the downward drift we are seeing. Many trying to quietly move out/over without dropping the price too abruptly perhaps.

My other question is what is the effect at the end of the day - maturity? Assuming a rise in stock price, does conversion only happen financially or are shares delivered? Where do those shares come from and what is the effect?

Finally, it would seem that driving shares to convertibles through aggressive shorting is likely part (a tool) of a larger strategy played by the house professionals. Possibly part of a reversible strategy depending on the direction of stock price momentum?",,0,0,0,0

This is confusing to me; the previous lane departure warning system only vibrates the wheel when it believes you have inadvertently crossed out of your lane and it can be disabled and stay that way; it never took control of the car.

The new feature is the one that does not remain disabled and will take control when it believes it needs to so... what settings are actually on in your car?

thanks

So, there are a few things...

The old system:
Lane Departure Warning (aka Lane Assist) would vibrate the steering wheel, and could be deactivated.

The new system:
1) Lane Departure Avoidance (can be forever deactivated, select Off)
Off - It's off
Warn - Only vibrates the wheel like the old system
Assist - Without a blinker, it takes control and steers you back into your lane (25-90 MPH). It does not vibrate (I haven't felt it yet).

2) Emergency Lane Departure Avoidance (can only be deactivated for one drive, then automatically turned back on) - this is a collision avoidance system and a chime will sound and the car will steer you back into your lane to avoid an accident.

Come the end of July at the Q3 earnings report Tesla should be able to accurately give guidance not only to Q3 revenue and cash flow, but also the amount of revenue and cash flow which will be generated in a quarter with full 3k GF3 production (most likely Q2, give or take a quarter). 

If Tesla gives that kind of specific guidance, and is able to also say that (1) 7k sustainable M3 production has been achieved and (2) demand is strong, then the near term success of Tesla will be clear to all except the irretrievably brainwashed. And it really shouldn’t matter to the near term SP whether GF3 first reaches full production in Q1, Q2 or Q3. Or whether Q2 deliveries are more or less than 90k.

The market looks forward. Guidance is the key. I’m feeling reasonably optimistic that Tesla will be in the best position ever in July to give very substantive and positive guidance.

3708159,Charging for Liberal Arts Majors,ewoodrick,2019-05-31 06:38:00,"Tesla charging options - 

HPWC - Hard-wired Wall charger with Tesla connector for car
UMC - Mobile Connector with available adapters for many plugs. A 14-50 adapter and standard 120V 15A adapters used to be standard, but they are dropping some options. Make sure you have both. The connection to the wall plug is not designed to handle daily plugging and unplugging, that's why I have two, one stays at home, one in the car.
Tesla Destination Charger - Public chargers, similar to HPWC that are located at many locations, such as hotels and offices.
J-1772 - The most common EV plug solution. Tesla requires the J-1772 adapter to use. I'd recommend having one, again, Tesla may no longer be including these.
The cables listed above are all referred to as Level 2, which means that a full charge may take hours and are best used for overnight charging. Some J-1772 are free, some are paid. And while you can sometimes use a credit car when you pay, there are a number of different networks around the country and if you find the need to charge at them often, you may want to join that network.

Tesla Superchargers are available and primarily designed for long range travel. They provide the ability to cross the country. These are not free (unless you have free Supercharging) and are charged to the Credit Card on your Tesla account. While some think that they are extremely expensive (they are more expensive than home charging) they are relatively cheap when compared to DC Fast chargers that other EVs use. A Supercharger can charge to about 80% in under an hour, new V3 chargers can be even faster.
Due to an early promotion from Tesla to get people to but cars (free Supercharging for life), some Superchargers are located in metropolitan areas (especially SoCal and SanFran) and can be very busy. 

So, in general, my recommendation

Charge at home. This is an awesome user experience
Charge at Superchargers when travelling. When combined with breaks, this doesn't necessarily extend trip time when compared to ICE
Have UMC with NEMA 14-50 and 5-15 adapters in addition to J-1772 adapter when travelling. A number of hotels provide charging options, in addition, the 5-15 adapter can plug in anywhere
Daily charging at Supercharging ONLY when you don't have L2 charging available at home or work.
Yes, it is a little confusing, and dependent on your travel needs, different options may be better. But if you go with the above option and maybe a heavy duty (very important) 25ft extension cord, then you can probably solve all of your charging needs.

For J-1772 plug (as well as Tesla) locations, use Plugshare web or app.

For better understanding of how far you can go, get in the car and say ""Navigate to New York City"" after a few minutes, you should receive the route, each Supercharger that you have to stop at and how long. Once you get rid of some range anxiety, you will realize that this is only a suggestion and that other option are available. Also, remember that this gets you to your destination, you may want to stay a little longer a your last stop to make sure that you have power to get around after arriving.

<snip>
In regards to your last point, I agree that self-driving cars should be very careful around pedestrians of course. However, pedestrians do have a responsibility as well to follow the rules and not to jay walk for example. So yes, a self-driving car should slow down near crossings when they see pedestrians. But the task of predicting whether a pedestrian is actually going to jay walk or not is a very difficult one. A self-driving car should be safe but it cannot be expected to read minds. Again, I think pedestrians have a responsibility to follow the rules too. This would be true if cars were self-driving or not.<snip>
""

I could not be more in disagreement with this statement and what seems to be the underlying thinking.

If a person is standing between parked cars in the middle of the block and steps out into the street, it is absolutely the responsibility of the driver to have recognized the situation and be prepared to stop even though it's jaywalking. If a child is running across a sidewalk and continues out into the street, the driver is responsible have anticipated what might happen and to stop. You don't have to be a mind reader to understand what's going on around you.

I could not be more in disagreement with this statement and what seems to be the underlying thinking.

If a person is standing between parked cars in the middle of the block and steps out into the street, it is absolutely the responsibility of the driver to have recognized the situation and be prepared to stop even though it's jaywalking. If a child is running across a sidewalk and continues out into the street, the driver is responsible have anticipated what might happen and to stop. You don't have to be a mind reader to understand what's going on around you.

Jaywalking isn't a capital offense and drivers aren't authorized to be executioners.

Here's a pic of the lip I'm getting. It doesn't look too drastic of change from stock: 


My main concern has to do with my gf driving the car. Fortunately she doesn't drive it much. I've had some bad experiences in the past with low cars. Not with me driving but when others are driving my car. I had a C6 Corvette that was not lowered and my gf cracked the front end exiting a driveway. I had a lowered 300C SRT8 that my cousin was driving that ended up with the front bumper half ripped off. So yea I'm a bit paranoid now lol. It's been a while (10+ years) since I've driven a lowered car. If it's too much of a hassle I might just leave it stock height. But then I would have to put up with those hideous fender gaps. Ugh.

Just to clarify, those measurements you did were all post-spring installation, correct? It does give me hope that you said you can enter your driveway straight on. Do you have a pic of the driveway? I also have a decently steep driveway at my place. Can you take most speed bumps straight on? I always found it annoying to go over speed bumps in a crowded parking structure since there are cars next to you going the opposite direction. Which doesn't leave much room for you to angle your car properly.
""

Yes, all post installation. I've gone over dozens of speed bumps and road humps, and have been able to take all of them head on, so I wouldn't worry about it. Looking at your lip, it doesn't doesn't look too bad and seems to have some tapering, I don't think it'll be lower than the piece in front of the rear wheels. As stated, I only had an issue on this really awkward driveway/ramp. It's such an atypical ramp and not part of a road/driveway, I'm not worried about it. It's poorly designed and angled and I only briefly touched that rear trim piece underneath where there would never be any visual damage.

It might. Elon counts of people not willing to sue and notice the message is very clear that new cars are not affected, so that it doesn't affect new car sales. He pulled it off when he advertised 691hp for P85D, told everyone that the power update is coming over the air, then for two years radio silence with an exception of JB's try to explain to people that electric horsepower is somehow different than ICE horsepower, then once they had a P100D which does produce the advertised hp, settled the suit in Europe, admitted P85D only produced 463hp, BUT new cars are not affected! Nobody sued them here in the US (that we know of), even though the ""P"" upgrade was $25K.

Respectfully, the 691hp was not as broadly impacting as the screen issue. The screen issue answer, “cosmetic anomaly,” is like putting lipstick on a pig. The more the issue gets publicized, the more people will see how stupid the lipstick looks, and it’s still a big fat pig. Marketing 101.

Looking at a review of the Model 3 yesterday it offered alternatives at the end, with the suggestions being the I-Pace or the new BMW 3 series, which are the only two other cars I've really considered in any depth, so the review knows what people tend to be looking at, it seems!

But really both cars are built on an electric skateboard platform, so are quite similar in how they drive, other than bodywork differences and a bit of additional weight for the Jag and additional power for the Tesla.

In terms of who they serve, they're both mid-size cars in terms of interior space and boot space, both are quite quick, decently sporty to drive and yet cheap to fuel. Although the Model 3 is more efficient, I've read that both cars get around 200 - 220 miles from a charge with mixed driving, so they're not vastly different there either. Crucially, both are cheaper to fuel than any ICE car, so it's almost irrelevant. And if I buy the Tesla for the better power/acceleration then I'm going to use the power more quickly anyway if I'm using that ""feature"" of the Tesla.

I think the main things for me are that the I-Pace is more expensive Vs the M3P without full autonomous driving, its infotainment is very laggy and slow, and it's not as quick as the M3P in terms of acceleration.

The M3P however, is missing some key options (literally every option I spec'ed on the I-Pace isn't even available on the Model 3 at all, and much of the standard equipment is also unavailable), and I'm somewhat wary about support. (Literally one local service centre, nowhere to even see or test drive the car before buying). I've heard that if, say, an accident occurred, it can take weeks or longer to get replacement parts/panels. Also, despite quality perhaps improving, I think it's still likely below an established brand like Jaguar, and it sounds like the Tesla paint is very thin and often not as well applied as top marques. Older Jags may not have a great reliability record, but there are less moving parts on this one and they are built in Austria where quality is supposed to be better. There are no suggestions of quality issues with the Jag so far (just some software problems being fixed in updates).",,0,0,0,0

A lot has to do with Tesla's power as a market leader and trend-setter. If Tesla has enough ""trend-setter appeal"" to make the celebrities and other influencers decide that a simple/spartan interior is the next, cool, modern thing, then that will draw in the younger demographic. And once that happens the entire bandwagon will follow with Tesla at the head of the line.

Does Tesla have the market power to do that? Maybe. Certainly GM or Ford couldn't pull it off. Tesla just might.
""

Why bother make the Model S or X anymore if they're just all going to be exactly the same? 

Different people have different tastes and making them all identical with slightly larger dimensions is cutting off the differences that drive different buying motives. Sure there's outliers but by and large human psychology is human psychology. There's a large group of people who like the idea of EV and all that Tesla offers but some things are just TOO much change for them to be comfortable with. These people also tend to have the most money of any segment of the population: Older folks.

I, for one, will stick with 2019 and earlier Model S much in the same way I don't want a Model X. I just don't like the way they look. Others do and I can see why and don't think they need to make the Model X more like the Model S just because I like it better but that's how many who own Model 3's think. I still don't get that.

There's a reason well-established vehicle manufacturers gravitate towards making their entry-level cars the more edgy version and their higher-end cars tend to be more classic and timeless. They're geared towards their individual buying segments and it's the wise thing to do. You can disrupt all you want but fighting basic human buying motives will be a losing battle overall.",,0,0,0,0

Tornadoes Ravage Midwest, Injuring Scores

The Kansas City, Missouri, area was the latest to be hit during a 12-day stretch that’s seen at least eight twisters strafe the Midwest — the first such series since 1980. Ohio’s governor declared a state of emergency in three counties, while storms were also confirmed in eastern Pennsylvania. Even parts of New York City and northern New Jersey were issued warnings by the National Weather Service.

What’s causing these tornadoes? While scientists say climate change probably plays a role in their increased frequency, they’re hard-pressed to pinpoint exactly why.
""

Of course you and all of the other science-denying global warming kool-aid drinkers here believe that mythical AGW is causing the greater-than-normal severe weather this month but the reality is that it is the unusual cold this spring in the Midwest that is the cause. Anyone with an elementary knowledge of weather and climate knows that you need a collision of warm air (always present in late spring/early summer) and cold air (unusually cold this year in parts of the Midwest) to cause tornadoes and severe storms. Sorry to rain (pun intended) on your alarmist parade but tornadoes are rare in the tropics where it is much warmer than it is in the Midwest so warm air alone is only half of the equation - not that any of you AGW cultists care. BTW, severe (F3 or greater) tornadoes are becoming less frequent:

The website is still showing a 2 week lead time for all Model 3’s. I’m not sure where someone heard 6-8 weeks. That may be specific for Canadian orders which always take much longer than US orders.

If you ordered the car on May 28 you should get the 5000 miles regardless of your delivery date. It’s the order date that determines eligibility. Just make sure that you confirm this at delivery before you sign any paperwork. And always get it in writing.
""

The website is showing ""within 2 weeks"" (recently verified this a few moments ago) - it's inside the Tesla account page, on the right side column, which reads ""6-8 weeks"". Tesla is promising ""within 2 weeks"" to the public, and a very much later delivery date range to those who have ordered.

I am not concerned with receiving the 5000 supercharging miles referral. I originally brought that up as my rationale behind the 6-8 weeks delivery wait, the rush to order on the referral's last day (I am one of them) - compounded with the halving of fed tax credit.

I have it in writing that I will receive the 5000 supercharger miles. However there is a concern - taking delivery of the car before July 1. Delivery Advisor said he's not worried, but I can't help it sometimes. My wife who I went to great lengths to convince to purchase the car says if we don't get the full tax tax credit, we're dropping the order.

""

Seems to me that drawing a conclusion from the vague language used by Ms Leuders is ill-advised.

Quote from article: 
——————————————-
During this part of the presentation, Ms. Lueders repeatedly used the phrases “may need” and “might” to refer to potential changes in the SuperDraco propulsion system. 

This language is admittedly not common in the aftermath of anomalies of this kind that have historically in the U.S. human spaceflight arena always led to some kind of significant change to the vehicle. 

To this end, Ms. Lueders’ language could be read one of two ways: the first being that she was simply hedging her language as the investigation has not revealed the root cause of the anomaly at this time and therefore changes “might be” coming via information revealed at a later date.

The second option is that the investigation has revealed a specific cause for the anomaly and that the cause has been traced to something that occurred after Crew Dragon splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean after its mission.

BTW, there are 3 hydrogen refill stations around here. Local Honda dealers recently advertise Honda Clarity lease:

$379/month, $2878 drive off for 3 years, 20000 miles/year
$5000 CA HFCV rebate(even for lease)
$15000 hydrogen fuel credits
21 days of rentals from Avis

I think I read that article yesterday. I'm also not sure the driving experience will necessarily be better in the Model 3. Sure, it's quicker, but the Jag is routinely said to have the best feel and handling of any electric car. It's also available with adaptive air suspension, and in all honesty 4.5 secs to 60 isn't slow. Still faster than all but the fastest version of the Model 3.

Admittedly 0-60 in 3.2 puts the Model 3 in another league in terms of acceleration though, but that's only really a benefit if you're going everywhere flat out. In reality that's not the case on public roads, which leaves me wondering if I'd then be happier with the more generous equipment in the Jag.",,0,0,0,0

I've read in some threads that, apparently, Tesla asks you to pay your remaining balance before delivery of the car?

Is this true?

If so, what kind of crack is Tesla on?

Give me the car. AFTER I inspect it and I am ready to drive away, THEN you get your check. 

Anything less is a lawsuit. I'm getting a little sick of Tesla the company right now. I don't ""wait"" well and I certainly don't do b.s.
""

I’m in CA and I gave the home delivery guy a personal check after inspecting. So you are ok with what you want to do.

However, I don’t understand how “anything less is a lawsuit”. If you don’t like their policy, you cancel the order, get the order fee back, and move on. What law or contract would Tesla break to warrant a lawsuit if they ask for payment prior to delivery?

Tesla is a quirky company. There are many great things about it, but there are a lot of things that will for sure require patience. You say you don’t “wait”. If you ever have service issues, you are most likely going to have to wait and be patient in interacting with Tesla.

Anytime I needed to know what was happening, I would call the 888 service number and would be told we are waiting on XXXXX. The website nor anyone else contacted me to inform me what was needed. Throughout the whole process, I was required to go figure out what was needed.

When there is a problem, most of the time it's my right repeater that has 0MB files, but there have been instances where the right is fine and it's the left repeater with 0MB files. Sometimes the right or left repeater file sizes are small and the video is pixelated, other times everything works fine. Never had an issue with the Recent folder so I don't think it's a physical repeater problem for me.

Maybe those who have not had any issues at all can post what their using? We can collect some data in case certain drives perform better than others?
""

Many of us have ruled out an issue with the USB drive. Most of us are using USB drives which operate under high temperature, low power, and are high-speed (far higher than required for writing these small video files). 

The main difference I have seen has been between firmware releases. I have had relatively stable releases, and then from time to time, unstable releases. This morning, all of my video files worked fine on the way to the office. Yesterday, they were working only partially. There seems to be some operating condition which is restricting the ability to write and/or transcode the video files reliably. If I had access to the MCU, I'd keep an eye on the resources (using tools like atop).

My ($37K new) Camry wasn't even close to flawless. It had a bit of weirdness going for some gaps. Nothing major, of course. About th same as my Model 3 (difference being Tesla sent someone to my house to fix the Model 3). I also know of at least one paint glob that was factory, because I noticed it there years later as I was cleaning up the car to sell it.

Toyota does tend to put out a very durable product. But ""flawless production"" they are not.

The other thing going on is that dealerships hide a LOT of this stuff from consumers. And most people don't actually look for it, anyway, so you don't hear about this stuff so much if there isn't a rondel or a T or something on the hood. Transit just beats things up, to an extent. Clearly some Tesla SC are better than others at this, at this point. Not sure that's QC proper, though.

So, I was dumb enough to be an early adopter. Got a 2016 Model X. Was in the shop for a month when first purchased. Continued problems since. In the last six months, motor blew out and was replaced, front door hinge failed (again) and was replaced, storage compartment sliding door failed and had to be replaced, visor broke and was replaced. This is after many, many prior issues. Latest thing is that there is a firmware bug that doesn't recognize that my software update is the latest version. Been in the shop multiple times to try to fix. Ultimately they said it is a bug that needs to be addressed in a future software update, but all the updates for at least two months are already scheduled. In the meantime, I have an error message (Software Update Required - Contact Service Center) and beep that pops up every ten seconds. Makes it almost unbearable to drive. But Tesla's response is I'm SOL.

I cancelled my Model 3 reservation and discouraged many people from buying a Tesla because of my horrible ownership experience. Car is great when it works, which is almost never.

I got rear ended in a minor fender bender in my pearl white M3 the other day, and I'm looking into finding the best place to get it fixed. The thing I'm most worried about is the matching of the pearl white paint on the repaired rear bumper. I have an option to go to a Tesla owned body shop in San Jose, which is about an hour from home or to go to a Tesla approved body shop with excellent Yelp reviews just down the street from my house. Do you think there is an advantage of going to one versus the other? Would the Tesla owned shop be more capable of matching the paint than the approved body shop? The Tesla owned shop told me that the pearl white is the only M3 that has some variance in the coloring. What are your thoughts?

Also, does anyone have experience getting their pearl white repairs to match at either a Tesla approved or owned body shop?
""

I was also rear-ended 2 weeks ago in San Jose. I ended up taking my Multicoat Red M3 to A Superior Collision Shop in Campbell as it is an approved Tesla body shop and was also on the other party's insurance company's (Statefarm) list of approved body shops. 

I considered going to go to the Tesla Body Repair Center but they informed me that I would have to get a damage estimate from another body shop and send that along with pictures of the damage before they would even schedule me for an appointment.

I think those saying that this model makes Tesla look greedy argue that they could have chosen to lock it at 350 km (roughly analogous to the US SR), but instead locked it at 150 km in a deliberate attempt to not sell any of the locked ones and sell more of the SR+.
""

I think the bigger reason why we dont see an SR- (150 km) + SR (US) + SR+ in Canada is the government would never allow that since the SR- and SR(US) are the same car, that would be simply a loophole to allow people to by a 47k car and still qualify for the rebate.

Whether it is typical or not is up to people to assess based on their own research, including posts like this.

And the attitude that it serves me right for being a fan and sitting on a waiting list for a year to get a really really poorly built car is essentially the same as Tesla's attitude and there's something wrong with that.

Both the LR and MR reach their max range by using .23kwh/mi (75/325 & 62/265). My battery rundown tests on my SE+ indicate that it’s a 50kwh pack, meaning that to get the advertised 240 miles, I’d have to have an average kWh/mi of .208, which is 10% better than on the LR/MR. to get 220 miles out of a battery locked to 45kwh, you’d have to do .204kwh. HOWEVER, to get 220 miles out of the 50kwh pack, you need to get — drumroll — .227 kWh/mi, the same as on the MR/LR.

My theory is that the SR+ was conceived at the 11th hour when it became obvious that the standard interior SR was too expensive to build, and that the SR+ pack advertised for 240mi was the pack intended for the 220mi SR. The SR+ isn’t really an SR+, it’s an SR — the current SR is an SR-.",,0,0,0,0

There’s a company called Oracle Finance who is also offering me a contract ‘with balloon payment’. They say it’s not a PCP deal though. Slightly confused. Will let you know once I have more details.
""

I’ve just had a look at this and the product they are talking about is the “Lease Purchase”. The big difference between this and PCP is that one way or the other you are committed to paying the balloon payment at the end. From their website the options are: 


Purchase the car, by paying the deferred balloon
Part-exchange the car, using any equity towards your next vehicle
Sell the car privately, retaining any equity once the balloon has been paid
Refinance the final balloon payment
Note that you do not have the option of handing the car back at the end of the term as you do with PCP. Bullet points 2 and 3 only work if the car is worth more than the balloon, and that’s very definitely an unknown factor so not to be relied on IMO.

Unless you can save up for the balloon payment bullet 1 and 4 are essentially the same thing. No problem with that in principle subject to you being in the position to borrow the amount required over a term that is affordable.",,0,0,0,0

It is possible to make hydrocarbon fuels from scratch if you have a source of energy. You can use solar or wind power as the energy source to make liquid hydrocarbons out of water (for the hydrogen) and CO2 (for the carbon). You will have oxygen as a waste product of the process, which you can release into the air, or compress it for sale. (There's a big market for oxygen. It's used for welding, for deep diving, for some medical applications, for rockets, and probably lots of other things as well.) Since the carbon comes from CO2, this is a carbon-neutral fuel cycle. Because liquid hydrocarbons are more energy-dense than either compressed H2 or batteries, they are still the fuel of choice for long-range aircraft. This process would allow you to fly planes on jet fuel without adding carbon to the atmosphere (since the carbon came from the atmosphere to begin with) and have a sustainable energy source (the wind or solar you used to make the hydrocarbons.

Do we think there's any chance of entire edge-cases being learned by the neural network?

Going back to the ""how do humans learn to drive"" question, I don't think I was ever taught how to respond to a single-lane bridge (e.g. FSD Use Case 1 - Single Lane Bridge). I just slowed down, observed what other people did in that scenario, and quickly learned you take turns.
""

Well, human NN is very quick at learning - and it does so with very few examples. But then, there is 15 years of ""general intelligence"" training already in place that gets used.



With fleet learning, could the neural network learn entire scenarios? If the network has seen how human drivers respond to seeing a yield sign and a narrowing of the road-space, could it perform an entire maneuver when confronted with a similar situation? Or will the neural network always just be relegated to parsing what the cameras see, with traditional software doing the responding?
""

I think they are taking both approaches. In the autonomy day they talked about how you can predict the driving path using NN. They want to move more things to NN from heuristics - but some things are easier with heuristics. NN may be used to predict what each object on the road may do next, for eg. - but heuristics will decide what action to take based on those inputs.

""

Economically feasible at scale is a challenge right now.

The other thing you need to keep in mind is efficiency. 

Between the grid, charger, battery, inverter, and motor, probably 75% of the energy that goes into charging an EV ends up moving the car.

Cracking the water, compressing the hydrogen, transporting the hydrogen, leaks, then fuel cell efficiency and finally motor efficiency might leave you with 30-40% of the energy you put in actually moving the car.

I don't have a good handle on the efficiency of creating the synfuel, but the typical car only ends up putting about a quarter of the energy in the fuel in the tank into moving the car. Given that, I""m gonna guess you get about 10% of the energy that went into making the fuel out the back end. And you still get NOx and CO emissions from the combustion process.

Batteries are better for cars and anything else where you don't *need* the energy density like airplanes and rockets do. Batteries also let you stabilize a grid filled with renewables, and save a bunch of money and pollution on keeping power plants hot and ready to meet demand.",,1,0,0,0

I made up a mounting system for them using simple channels and zip-ties for those 2, and the Tesla screws for the other 3. I will print out and take photos for you all tonight. The brackets SHOULD work even for the 3rd hole in the center of the dash (with the super-low clearance speaker mid). I measured them there and the bracket works in that spot, but I am not willing to cut loose the wires blocking the new larger magnet underneath the hole. You certainly can if you'd like.
""

No worries about relocating that wiring loom. It is easy to take a piece of heavy-duty tape and tape it to the front side that is the side nearest the steering wheel of the mounting hole. This leaves tons of space for the larger magnet speakers. If you do not relocate the wiring loom you cannot use the Infinity reference 4022 you might be able to get the Faital 4 inch driver to fit however.",,0,0,0,0

I have never had such horrible service. BMW has been phenomenal. I hope the Tesla service center is much better.
""

I have a Telsa and a BMW currently. The former is on another level as far as sheer day-to-day driving enjoyment and overall technology. Just incredibly impressive. However the one time I've needed a replacement part (broken exterior mirror) it took 3+ weeks! A tech came to my house to install it and it was relatively inexpensive too, which helped but did not make up entirely for the fact I had to drive the car for 3 weeks without a mirror. Buying an inventory car was relatively painless for me but the delivery was very odd and unprofessional.

The BMW customer service is pretty good and I can get nearly any part locally overnight if needed. Unfortunately the car is just not competitive with my Tesla. Not really even close IMO. The delivery experience was very professional and everything went in an expected way.

Unfortunately you can't get the best of everything and have to choose which is more important to you. For me the daily driving experience is most important as that's what I spend 99% of my time doing. If I spent 99% of my time dealing with Tesla Service I'd get a different car.",,0,0,0,0

I think just normal supply issues are the more likely culprit.

While true, that's probably not the reason. U.S. legislators have never made safety regulations for industry unless it directly affected them. (Repeated info, so skip if already known). In the days of the railroad barons, Westinghouse developed a safety brake for trains, which would reduce the number of accidents. Every railroad baron was against putting this on because it would harm profits and the railroad would go bankrupt (according to them). Eventually a Congressman's family was killed in a railroad accident and legislation was pushed through. It turned out that this made the railroad barons more money than before because they could schedule more trains on a given track. Freight companies not putting on side guards is the same flawed logic. This logic is also why the U.S. is not leading the way in renewable energy and is now calling gas ""freedom molecules"" instead of ""death molecules"".

There is more (quoting):

The study also raised questions about the long-term viability and industry acceptance of side underride guards, which are still in the developmental stage and for which no federal standards currently exist.

“Side underride guards are being developed, but stakeholders GAO interviewed identified challenges to their use, such as the stress on trailer frames due to the additional weight,” GAO said. “NHTSA has not determined the effectiveness and cost of these guards, but manufacturers told GAO they are unlikely to move forward with development without such research.”

Regarding single-unit trucks, such as dump trucks, the National Transportation Safety Board has recommended that NHTSA develop standards for underride guards, but the agency has concluded that “these standards would not be cost-effective,” GAO said.

While being able to sleep (or work) in the car while it is driving itself unattended is the scientific and social Holy Grail of FSD, the actual economic FSD Holy Grail is a much more modest technological and legal milestone:

""The Tesla FSD car/taxi has to be able to self-drive to its next destination without any passengers on board at all, with high success rates, regulatory permission in at least one major market and low legal exposure.""
On the actual trip where there are passengers in the car, one of the passengers is the designated driver with a driving license. (Just like the renting guest is responsible for an AirBnb home while using it.)

IMO this is the technological milestone that unlocks trillions in taxi, ride sharing and business fleet logistics revenue and this is the milestone enables the Tesla Network - and I agree with Elon that this could happen next year already. (!)

I think the first robotaxis will basically be long ""summon"" and ""park"" features. The car drives to customer location where the customer takes over and drives, using FSD as much as they dare.

Both the LR and MR reach their advertised range by consuming .23kwh/mi (75/325 & 62/265). My battery rundown tests on my SR+ indicate that it’s a 50kwh pack (which has been backed up by EPA tests and registration docs), meaning that to get the advertised 240 miles, I’d have to have an average kWh/mi of .208, which is 10% better than on the LR/MR. to get 220 miles out of a battery locked to 45kwh, you’d have to do .204kwh. HOWEVER, to get the advertised 220 miles of the SR out of the 50kwh pack, you need to get — drumroll — .227 kWh/mi, the same as on the MR/LR.

My theory is that the SR+ pack was intended to be the 220 mile SR pack, but at the 11th hour when it became obvious that the standard interior SR was too expensive to build for $35k, they rebranded it the SR+, priced it at a profitable $37k, and introduced the moderately crippled SR as a vehicle which was always intended to be pulled from the website ASAP — the only reason the SR ever existed was to avoid the PR nightmare of not having a $35k 3.

Digging more into this since I've never heard about it before, I'm not sure it's legit. Can someone who has it already confirm? Website looks kinda shady and there's no official endorsement by the DMV anywhere on the site or the DMV's site. Only thing I found were the legislative bills referenced, and those never mentioned a 3rd party only that they will be issued by ""the department"".
""

I've done this on my car. I probably put the plate about 5mm lower than I would have liked (to avoid interfering with the radar), so it looks not as good as I would like, but it's legit. I also managed to get it approximately 1mm lower on one side than the other, in spite of my best efforts to make it perfectly level and centered. It is important, in any case, to not put it any higher than the standard Tesla plate mount - which makes it kind of low, as it has to curl into the front lower opening. (The other thread describes some of these difficulties I think.)

In advance of receiving the wrap, I got an official letter from the California DMV saying this was a pilot program, and that if the pilot program were discontinued, I would need to ""immediately"" put the standard plate back on. And also I'm supposed to carry the normal plate in the car. (I plan to ignore these words of advice for the time being.)",,0,0,0,0

So I saw someone mention that their interior color was wrong. Curious, I checked my own and sure enough it had listed Black interior when I had chosen White interior. I'd taken screenshots, and my Order Agreement was still correct, but the order details were clearly wrong.

I called SA and he said it would be no problem because Order Agreement is the gold standard, but in any case about 2 hours later I got a confirmation of change order... Then a new Order Agreement (this one included discount for Ludi) and a new ""Order placed"" date of 5/30... Really hoping that didn't just nullify the 3 weeks I've waited so far.

I had the exact same situation happen to me. I ordered white and had my SA add the carbon fiber on May 4th. On Memorial Day I noticed my order details changed to black. Texted my SA and he responded within 5 minutes on Memorial Day! I was impressed! He saw what I saw and put a request in to change it back. I asked him if this screw up would delay my order. He said absolutely not!

My order agreement changed to white with carbon and has the discounted Ludicrous now and a order placed date of 5/29.

I was hoping for delivery by next weekend but still don't have a vin.

So I checked my order, and the same thing happened to me. Tesla has some sort of database corruption. When I spoke to a sales advisor, what I was told was that as far as Tesla was aware the wrong interior was the car I was going to get. I insisted it was right back in April when it was confirmed, and that I did not request a change. He put in a change order to fix it but he was unsure if it would push my delivery out even further. No one I've spoken to in the last month has known anything about the production status for the car, including today. He told me to hope for a VIN next week.

Yes, and they are on the cusp of doing this. 2017, Tesla profit was -2 billion. 2018, Tesla profit is -1 billion. 2019..they might break even depending on the rest of the year (and looks to be on track).

That looks like a maturing company to me utilizing ONLY 1/3 of their products and only ONE product that is for the masses.

Other money makers include Semi, Solar Roof, and 800lb gorilla that's the Model Y. So all this crying about ""how dare they lose money!..What a *sugar* company"" is a ridiculous premise when you see their YOY revenue growth is over 50% while operational cost stays roughly flat.
""

I think you misrepresent the posts you read. Where did anyone say Tesla is going to continue to lose money? The point is the will have to make money from here on out. However, it is not a GIVEN that they will make money going forward. That's all I'm pointing out. 

While they did loose less money in 2018 than in other years, 2017 was a big loss year because so much money was being pumped into ramping up the model 3 production. While they have bank loans for the Shanghai physical plant, they will still need to pay out full salaries as they train employees and then ramp up production. 

The model Y production won't require a building, but they will need to outfit the line and again, train employees and ramp up production. Just like in 2017 and the first half of 2018 this is likely to put them in the red for the foreseeable future. It is possible that the Shanghai plant may make enough to put them in the black going forward, but that will depend on the demand level in China which we have no insight into presently. Even with the model Y in production, there will be some level of competition which may impact demand. I get the impression that Tesla doesn't have much resilience to deal with demand much below the capacity of the plants. 

I get that everyone, including me, wants Tesla to succeed. But they are not over the hump by a long shot. I don't get why this idea seems to antagonize people. If you don't believe it, ok. Just post your analysis and we can discuss it. But does that mean I have to agree with you?",,0,0,0,0

This is a fair point. However v9 was a drastic change from previous releases. v9 reminds me of... Window ME... which a lot of people disliked and stayed on Win7. MS still provided security updates etc for Win7 (and they sort of still do)... just as Tesla could.

However, I understand Tesla's resources are small... and this is likely the crux of the issue; v9 was designed for the 3... which now outsells the S/X by huge margins. The math tells them to continue to focus on the 3 landscape UI and just shoehorn it onto the now minority S/X portrait UI.

So what happens if I have this enabled and something falls out of the truck in front of me. Say a plastic bucket and this happens at least once a year. I go to swerve. Will I not be able to do so?
""

Not an issue. 

First of all ELDA will not trigger unless it sees an “emergency”. There are some fake ones, but often there are none. It will let you swerve out of lane, but not if it expects you to possibly hit an obstacle. The trouble is that those can be trees, high grass, large road signs etc. that are close to the roadside. You usually know these are stationary and you'll miss them, but ELDA might not see it that way.

Secondly, ELDA steering is easy to overcome. It's most troublesome when you're on AutoSteer when you're not applying too much torque to avoid disengaging it. If you're swerving to avoid an obstacle I doubt you'll do it with a light touch. 

The only real dangers I've seen is not being familiar with its tug and overcompensating for it rather than just resisting its tug. Or indeed too light a touch when circumstances would dictate a firmer grip (cfr. AutoSteer).

That said, the ELDA sound might be disconcerting and might startle you.",,0,0,0,0

While I agree Tesla paint doesn't seem 'inferior', I'd like to share our experiences with a Pearl White Model 3 and a Blue Model 3-- NIGHT AND DAY differences!

I have washed them both, back to back in an afternoon and the pearl white paint is smooth as glass and dirt just wipes off easily when washing. There's something FAR different going on with my husband's blue paint. It's more pourous and grainy and you have to really apply a lot of rubbing pressure to get it clean.
It seriously takes me minutes to wash my white, and twice as long to wash his. And then after they dry, my white is glossy and shiny and his is dull and still has many dirty spots that I have to go back over again!!
The most telling difference is just running your hand over the wet hoods: white is smooth as glass; blue feels sandy or gritty (when clean).
Seriously a HUGE difference. I quit washing his because it's too timely and exhausting.

I am a Tesla fan, but if they are indeed using old parts on new production I will be seriously disappointed.

I am not sure how much DA knows about different hardware. My DA had no clue that there is new hardware. But I believe I received HW3.0 - based on the software version that the vehicle came with - 2019.7.105. I am on 2019.12.1.2 now.

Only if you're talking about a station with low utilization. For a highly congested location, where you have a 50/50 shot of having to pick a stall that starts out at 30 kW while the car next to you gets 120 kW, the difference between that and a guaranteed 150 kW (minimum, depending on vehicle) is not an insignificant difference. In fact it can double the charging time of the second vehicle.

And this assumes that the V2 superchargers are still in good shape. Many of the high-usage V2 superchargers are old and have frequent problems. I've often been quoted a 130 minute charge time to 80% at Mountain View (capped at ~30 kW), then moved to another stall and charged to that level 30 minutes. That's a 4x difference. Basically, if the two charges are sharing significantly less than 150 kW, charge time get really bad. Having 250 kW per station gives you decent performance even if half the chargers in the stack are dead.
""

Yes, that is true. So maybe V3 chargers will help to relieve congestion by replacing V2 chargers. Still, I'm pretty sure a V3 charger can't just be swapped in for a V2. The entire facility would need to be upgraded as the connection to the utility is sized to the V2 chargers. So it is pretty much as expensive as adding that many chargers. Also, the station would be down for some time to get this done and the utility company can be very slow on their end with an upgrade. 

Maybe they will upgrade in some locations rather than add new stalls. But for the most part it doesn't seem economical and is only an incremental improvement.",,0,0,0,0

Some (well, actually all) of the blue Model 3's I've seen look gorgeous. When you said a White vs Blue I thought for sure you were gonna say the White was the problem. Because there were lots of issues with White for a while. Blue was one of my top choices. I ended up Midnight Silver.

I've noticed a very distinguishable difference before and after washing the multi-coat red. After two weeks of dirt build-up on roads here, the red becomes dull and ordinary. After cleaning, and especially after polishing it really shines - and people do notice.

I first noticed it on the 2019 Accura NSX, and on a few other foreign cars (not super-class).

No worries about relocating that wiring loom. It is easy to take a piece of heavy-duty tape and tape it to the front side that is the side nearest the steering wheel of the mounting hole. This leaves tons of space for the larger magnet speakers. If you do not relocate the wiring loom you cannot use the Infinity reference 4022 or any similarly-sized speaker with a larger than stock magnet . Only speakers with neodymium Magnets will fit such as the Faital 4 inch driver. But it's nice to have options. In terms of my experience doing two model 3s, I have no worries about relocating that wire loom all of 2in.

This is good to know. I am worried about vibration, as you might imagine. If you haven't had any issues, then it makes me consider doing the same.

3710069,What is the Model 3 SR+ battery size?,peakshaving,2019-05-31 15:18:00,"lateulade said:
↑

I have a theory that the SR+ isn’t a “plus” at all, because the numbers don’t pan out. I own an SR+ myself, and the power consumption doesn’t make any sense.

Both the LR and MR reach their advertised range by consuming .23kwh/mi (75/325 & 62/265). My battery rundown tests on my SR+ indicate that it’s a 50kwh pack (which has been backed up by EPA tests and registration docs), meaning that to get the advertised 240 miles, I’d have to have an average kWh/mi of .208, which is 10% better than on the LR/MR. to get 220 miles out of a battery locked to 45kwh, you’d have to do .204kwh. HOWEVER, to get the advertised 220 miles of the SR out of the 50kwh pack, you need to get — drumroll — .227 kWh/mi, the same as on the MR/LR.

My theory is that the SR+ pack was intended to be the 220 mile SR pack, but at the 11th hour when it became obvious that the standard interior SR was too expensive to build for $35k, they rebranded it the SR+, priced it at a profitable $37k, and introduced the moderately crippled SR as a vehicle which was always intended to be pulled from the website ASAP — the only reason the SR ever existed was to avoid the PR nightmare of not having a $35k 3. In reality, the SR+ is the SR, and the SR is an SR-
""

I can somewhat believe 10% better than the LR/MR. Actually I absolutely believe 10% better than the MR. The LEMUR models used IGBTs on the inverter which ran hotter and had higher losses than the SiC ones found in LR and SR+ models. You can attribute a few percent to the switch back to SiC MOSFETs for all models, a few percent for less cooling needed for the inverter, and a few percent for the weight savings by having a smaller pack. 

Of course I could be wrong with the expected consumption but I'm am getting about 215wh/mi in my SR especially if it's mostly highway driving. I'm not even trying to hypermile... usually going about 70-80 mph.",,0,0,0,0

So I checked my order, and the same thing happened to me. Tesla has some sort of database corruption.

I insisted it was right back in April when it was confirmed, and that I did not request a change. He put in a change order to fix it but he was unsure if it would push my delivery out even further. No one I've spoken to in the last month has known anything about the production status for the car, including today. He told me to hope for a VIN next week.

PSA: If you are waiting for an order, you need to double check your interior now.

Tesla is going have a whole lot of black/ash interior rejected deliveries over the next couple weeks from folks that don't check, I can only assume.

3710086,Tesla Strategic Mistakes and Choices Ahead,SupersonicP3D,2019-05-31 15:23:00,"My friend and I were lamenting Tesla's financial situation/stock price, especially given how great the product is, and the conversation turned to recent strategic mistakes Tesla has made. Would be curious to get people's take on this and strategic choices ahead of it:

1. Not raising $5-10bn in equity last year when stock price was near $400. Would have been easier to exit the ""funding secured debacle"" with ""going private was operationally too difficult, so instead we're raising enough money so that Tesla never has to worry about short term financial results ever again."" Would make the whole cash/debt conversation moot and would have destroyed the shorts. Pair that with no more guidance, no more tweets, no investor days. At a price of $400 this would have been what, like 7-12% dilution?

2. Not leading with the Model Y. Now that we see it is effectively a vertically stretched Model 3, I cannot understand why they didn't lead with this. It probably costs $1k more to manufacture, if that, and the pricing premium could have easily been $5k+. Note this is true for all other car manufacturers - crossovers built on the same platforms as sedans still command a very healthy price premium. Demand in the US would have been stronger and longer lasting, and crossovers are a growing share of the European market. 

3. Focusing too much on new autopilot features vs. perfecting existing highway driving. To be fair, I'm not sure how much of a choice this was, but I certainly think they would have benefited from nailing adaptive cruise control before rolling out some of the other features. I would love for them to have focused on making cut-in recognition flawless (e.g., recognize other cars' turn signals) vs. rolling out enhanced summon or whatever, which is a feature I will never use.

4. Not marketing at all/losing the PR game. This worked when the customer base consisted of early adopters b/c enthusiasts naturally generate content that appeals to that segment. But everyday people don't care about Tesla'a 1/4 mile times and version 2019.16.2 vs 2019.16.3.2 - they just want the thing to work. I'm not advocating for Super Bowl ads, but it feels like Tesla's PR strategy is basically Elon tweeting, which is often bad. Related - making promises that can't be kept. 

5. Not having a more strategic tie-in to Tesla Energy. It seems like they're finally thinking about this, but I just don't understand why my car can't power my house in the event of a power outage. I get that I'd have to spend a few $k on electrical upgrades and parts, but this seems like a natural option to upsell people on when they buy a new car and would be a true differentiator. Or just using my car like a Powerwall and selling energy when prices are high and I don't need the range. 

6. Working on the roadster, semi, pick-up, insurance, robo taxis, etc. None of those things are lacking coolness and the pick-up is a very lucrative segment of auto manufacturing (best selling passenger automobile worldwide is the Ford F-Series), but Tesla can't afford to not focus right now. They should be focusing on operational efficiency, even if that means they're boring for a year or two. 

7. Not creating a software marketplace for the UI. This may be a big effort, and has security implications, but I just don't understand why I can't download a spotify or Apple music app. Or use Waze. Or listen to podcasts. Or integrate Alexa or Google Home. Or have messaging apps accessible via voice. I understand Slacker licensing, yada yada, but I'd be surprised if there wasn't a way to get out of that contract or at least open it up to other vendors. The UI is already the best in the business, but why should Tesla do all the work to maintain it?

8. Allowing internal culture/team issues to persist. There are great and terrible things about how Elon runs the show. But remember that Steve Jobs had Tim Cook running ops since the 90s, allowing him to be the crazy visionary, but also deliver profitable products on time. It doesn't seem like Elon has that. Maybe Jerome Guillen really steps up and owns that role, but if it's not him, someone has to.

Some of these are still choices Tesla can make, others are things they're actively working on (and maybe are in actual focus now), and others are no longer available to it. FWIW I think the general product arc (Roadster -> S -> X -> 3) was the right one and think Tesla's long term focus on self-driving is critical. I also think they overall make an amazing product. I would be curious to get others takes on the above and what you feel are the most important strategic decisions ahead of it.

To know how to go to ""N"" (Neutral) is certainly something critical to know.
I particular for example if you go to a car wash where your car will be moved will been wash.

- I this case you must still seat in the car while in Neutral otherwise when you will open the door to exit the car,
the car will automatically go to Park and hold the parking brake. 

- If you need to move or push your car by yourself, without anyone seating inside, you can use the summon with you phone App,
or use the Towing mode, which is accessible from the car display. However the Towing mode after 20 minutes will disengage,
so the car will return to Park mode, which might not something you want while using a car wash. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is however a way to keep the parking brake off, in particular if you car is lift from the ground,
while servicing your tires or brakes, without having someone sitting inside the car while in Neutral:

- Here are the instructions for avoiding the car to get in Park mode when in Neutral:

1. Buckle the driver's seat belt before sitting in the seat.

2. With the key fob inside the vehicle, sit in the driver's seat and press the break pedal to turn the vehicule on.
The speedometer and PRND are now displayed on the instrument cluster.

3. Shift the vehicle into neutral. This release the parking break.

4. Without leaving the seat, and with the brake pedal still depressed, open the driver's door 
and use a pen or a small screwdriver to engage the door latch to its fully closed position (second detent).
This causes the vehicule to behave as if the door is closed.

5. Exit the vehicle, it can now remain in neutral with the parking brake off. 
....
Now you can work on you wheels or brakes
....
6. Later on, to release the latch, pull the interior door handle, and to engage parking brake, shift back to Park.",,0,0,0,0

3710106,Tesla Sailboat,snort,2019-05-31 15:29:00,"Many ships built in the last decade or two have been diesel electric. For example, recent passenger liners use a device called an Azipod, which is an electric motor and propeller in a pod that hangs below the hull, and can be turned in any direction to go forwards, backwards, steer, go sideways, etc. There's a group of diesel engines running generators to power this and everything else in the ship. Tug boats and many others, such as Ferrys, do this or something similar. There was an experiment in Europe where they used batteries instead of the diesel. It worked, but was expensive. It would be most practical for a situation like a municipal ferry, where the ship spends over half its cycle at the dock being loaded and unloaded where it could be charged with the ferry version of a supercharger, with a relatively short trip. There's no opportunity for regenerative braking on a boat.

Solar power is at best a trickle charger on a ship, it's nowhere near enough to move it at anything like a reasonable speed.

Wind, on the other hand, has some potential, although from experiments so far it looks like it's more likely to be something that will save a few percent on fuel economy rather than a major source of propulsion.

My experience is that I very rarely take advantage of the acceleration in the city. My average speed often drops well below 15 mph, and in these situations, the cabin comfort, and road noise play a far more critical role. When taking family trips, I'd prefer creature comforts over acceleration. Autopilot is not recommended in these settings, so I also don't benefit from the automation features. The Model 3 Performance has a tight suspension, and you will feel every bump in the road. The other thing to realize (which is true of all EVs) is that when the temperature changes, your range will be impacted. When driving without HVAC, I will often get the EPA certified range, but that can change by up to 45-50% when turning on the heat (less when running AC). The paint issues can be overcome with PPF and ceramic coating, but I have heard that in freezing climates, where salt is less effective, and gravel is used, and people are reporting severe damage to the rocker panels and impact locations and have needed to install mud-flaps. The Model 3 is also exceedingly simple, which to me has been part of its allure, but does make it feel less like a luxury vehicle.

I don't think you can go wrong in either case; they both appear to be excellent vehicles. There are enough Model 3's on the roads these days that you can probably get a better idea of its operation by borrowing one for a day.

There have also been numerous reviews (if you can bare his boyish sense of humor) of these cars on YouTube by Bjorn Nyland that you may want to see. Good luck!
""

I would test drive them, but I'm in the UK and currently there are no Model 3's here that I could drive. I'll go and sit in one in a showroom tomorrow, but it's in a Mall, so I can't test drive the car.

There may have been posts about issues but that doesn't make the issues themselves ""frequent"". I have a May 2018 car so by all accounts it should be ""early"" and ""poor quality"". I've now done 40,000km with zero major issues, only a few minor warranty things of the kind you'd probably get with any car - all were dealt with by the ranger and I've never been to the service center. Paint and panels are no better/worse than other new cars (German and otherwise) that I've had and there's certainly no noticeable issues. Maybe I'm an outside case but I don't think so, it's just that most people with good experiences don't come posting about it, people with problems do.

FYI if you go looking you'll find quality issues with every brand - go surf the Audi e-Tron forums - with a couple of minutes surfing I found reports of:
- lots of software errors (some crippling the vehicle)
- rattles
- off-center steering wheels
- leaking roof/windshields
- door fabric coming off (1 month repair estimate)
- hood not latching and causing (you guessed it) more software warnings
- sun visor breaks off when you move it
- malfunctioning A/C

So if I browsed that forum I could conclude that Audi has a poor quality car on their hands? However suspect there's plenty of happy e-Tron owners with perfect quality.
""

I dunno, those are all pretty isolated things, the panel gaps and bad paint on Teslas are not. I watched a YouTube video earlier where the whole panel gap thing was made a big joke of because it's been mentioned enough to become common knowledge. Also, it's much easier to find an Audi dealer in the UK than a Tesla one and I'd feel much happier that any issues would be dealt with without any issue and with a courtesy car in the meantime. I'm not sure if that would be the case with Tesla in my area, even though there is a service centre not too far away.

How do you plan to charge if you drive the Jaguar? Seems to me that Tesla laid their advantage over other e-car manufacturers by building their proprietary charging network in advance of sales. I can literally drive almost anywhere and find a Tesla supercharger although I rely mostly on the home charger.
""

90% of my charging will be done at home. And here in the UK there are more regular chargers than Tesla ones, though admittedly the Tesla ones are faster and more reliable to use, so that's a definite advance to the Tesla, which can use both.

I know nothing about the iPace really (I think they are substantially more expensive), but I can tell you that my car was delivered with no problems in July. It's been perfect since then. I think if you going to lease the car the ""danger"" of a bad choice is far less. I love my Model 3 LR RWD. It's the most amazing car I've ever driven. Even now, a year on almost, I still look forward to driving it. If you were going buy a car I'd probably tell you that I think the Tesla batteries will outlast the iPace batteries. Tesla is simply the best in that category. But if you're leasing that doesn't really matter. The Supercharger network might be a consideration as well, but realistically in England nothing too far away, so range is much less of an issue than in the US. I think an LR could drive completely across England on one charge.
""

Range will mostly not be an issue for me, except on rare occasions when I'll need to charge away from home. Either way, I'm not worried about the batteries. There's only a few producers of such batteries in the world and I don't believe that one is any better than the other. In fact, Jaguar don't use the full capacity of the battery to ensure it lasts longer by not letting you fully charge or discharge it, plus it has good thermal management.

Sure, it's a lease, but that doesn't mean that I want to drive around in something with bad quality and paint falling off of it.

I am not sure how much DA knows about different hardware. My DA had no clue that there is new hardware. But I believe I received HW3.0 - based on the software version that the vehicle came with - 2019.7.105. I am on 2019.12.1.2 now.

My understanding is that 2019.12 was compatible with 2.5 an 3. Then 2019.16 came out originally for 2.5 only. Then 2019.16.3 came out specifically for HW3. HW3 also stores video files in a newer format. If you can park in an area with good Wi-Fi, 16.3 seems to be rolling out pretty quickly now for HW3.

I spent a couple hours on my computer when this happened, and eventually got the result I wanted. got a pretty serious door ding and dent, here is what happened.

1. Got back to car, noticed dent.

2. Went home, reviewed sentry footage. 7 events left a lot of footage to view, but it didn't take long to narrow it down to the offending vehicle. Watched footage of the offending vehicle pull in next to car. Watched mom get out of car, then the footage cuts out. When it resumes the entire family is behind their vehicle getting ready to walk away! It missed the ~20 seconds of video I needed where the rear door opened!

3. Start researching online, find that Tesla saves all video clips from last hour, etc. Immediately run an undelete app on the USB drive.

4. Recover ~400 video clips, 2 clips were corrupt. It was pretty obvious from scrolling through the previews that one of the 2 corrupt video files was the one with the footage I needed.

5. Tried 1,000 ways to view the file all worthless. Ready to give up, finally try 1,001 method to watch video and it works! Literally the video covers about 25 seconds of the missing footage. Pay $6 for video corruption fix.

6. Send video to offenders insurance, they take responsibility and agree to pay for the damage!

Sentry mode is awesome, and I wish this had worked more flawlessly, but i'm excited nonetheless. No other car would have been able to do what my Tesla did!

3710145,285/35/20 Tire Question,Pinegreen,2019-05-31 15:41:00,"I was hoping I could get a confirmation with 20x10 wheels and tire size.

I have a 2017 Model S and currently have 20x10 +32 for the rear setup of a staggered set of wheels. The wheels are running 275/35/20.

Will a 285/35/20 fit without rubbing? Or should I be looking at another set up with an offset a little bit higher like +33 to +35 (may be buying another set of wheels)?

I’ve searched and so far I’ve seen the following setups running 285/35/20 on the forums:

WedsSport FT-117 20x10 +35
Avant Garde M580 20x10 +38
Avant Garde M510 20x10 +35
TSW Nurburgring 20x10 +35

I did find one person running Avant Garde M510 20x10 +32 but there was no mention of rubbing (I PM them but have not heard back yet and the post was a little dated). 

It seems like 20x10 +32 is a little more aggressive than what others are running based on the numbers that I have found. The setup now is pretty much flush with the fender.",,0,0,0,0

Yes, in a multi-unit building it's easier to distribute power to all the units from a single three phase feed. 208V 3-phase is 120V to ground, so any single phase circuits are normal 120VAC.

It sounds like you don't need the speed up, but there are two ways to speed up the charging compared to the Gen2 Mobile Connector's 32A @ 208V.

1. A small boost transformer can be installed to bump the 208V up to 240V for your charging circuit.

Where I live, 96 kW (400 A 240 V) peak is the limit before they start requiring you to get three-phase service. It's a step change in electrical service levels.

Now do you get it? One 50 kW charger wouldn't affect much, but two 144 kW chargers means a whole new three-phase service.

Obviously if Tesla uses Powerpacks to buffer the battery power draw at the Supercharger, and the charger wasn't being used 24-7, they wouldn't actually need this service level from the grid. But batteries are expensive and I think they're getting the grid upgrades in most places.
""

What makes you think a car service center would not already have 3 phase service? 96 kW is pretty light weight for such a large facility.

You mean the classic nosecone? Yes, all P85Ds have that. Never heard it called an ""intake grill"" before. 



What's ""early""? My car is a P85D, not exactly an ""early adopter"" car. Also, where are you getting my VIN? If it were my first P85+ with a 15xxx VIN, perhaps that's ""early"". Was there a TSB about this? Was there any announcements to tell customers that their car is going to be silently updated without any notice or warning? As mentioned on the first page, what if I had an emergency and couldn't drive my car? What if someone died because I couldn't get them to a hospital in time? (sure, far fetched, but possible). I can fully understand and accept an update for safety reasons, but not without giving me some notice as to when and why and to expect my car to be immobilized during a timer period that I specified.
""

Yeah, the nosecone. So in early model s builds(ones that have the nosecone), the battery pack is not well protected. If one cell is in short circuit, the BMS can easily lose control of its temperature and involve other cells, which might lead to smoke even fire, just like the Shanghai incident. And due to charging designs and safety designs in early model s, the use of a socket connector or a frontal crash may cause a short circuit in the cell. Tesla fixed the issue in model S built later (ones without the nosecone) but did not recall the early ones to fix it, maybe because of cost? Either way, if you take a look at all ""caught fire on its own"" incidents that involve a Tesla, it's an early model S. No other model has this issue. 
As for the update, I don't approve how Tesla did it. Just like how I don't approve Windows 10 updates in the midst of my presentation. I certainly believe a notice is necessary.",,0,0,0,0

Lone Pine Supercharger users, rejoice! On March 27th, Tesla received planning approval for the expansion of the Lone Pine supercharger with 8 additional stalls. They are planning to pave a portion of the dirt lot to the west of the current lot and to install the 8 new stalls along with a new equipment pad + fence. The original 4 hardwired stalls will remain in place but I think the temporary pallet will be removed (though this was not explicitly addressed), which would leave a total of 12 stalls. According to the plans (staff report PDF, which includes the plans), the new stalls will be of the V2, traditional-style supercharger (i.e. 150 kW) variety. Only 2 of them will be pull-in forward stalls like the already existing 4. The other 6 will be placed along the curb for back-in use. That would make the trailer-friendly and non-trailer-friedly stalls evenly divided at 6 apiece. 

I've no information about building permits and the Inyo planning office told me they had no information about schedule nor any estimate for when construction might start. But the guy I spoke to did say that Tesla seemed a bit annoyed at the delay entailed in having to go through the review process again for just an expansion. From which, I, somewhat optimistically, hypothesize that they're trying to get it built and operational before Thanksgiving (and/or the start of Mammoth's ski season) this year.

3710255,Papafox's Daily TSLA Trading Charts,Papafox,2019-05-31 16:25:00,"Lots of issues were in the stock price mix today including in-the-dumpster macros, realization that Tesla's exposure to the Mexico tariffs is very light compared to other auto companies in U.S., China M3 prices announced and pre-orders begin, and finally a day without a notable analyst downgrade (did the shorts get the sequencing wrong)? 

Despite the considerable pressure from the macros, Tesla managed to break free of the multiple mandatory morning dips (see the icicles?) and find green. It wasn't easy. Look at the multiple pushdowns as TSLA approach the red/green line. When TSLA finally broke through, the shorts were apparently careful to chop off the climb just below 190 to avoid a further rally. 



The NASDAQ opened quite low and peaked in the red at 11:30am and 1:45pm before heading down again

Comparing the NASDAQ chart to the TSLA chart, you can see that there was moderate correlation between the two, but generally the NASDAQ made relatively small changes while the market magnified these gyrations with TSLA.

Notice that when volume is relatively heavy in the morning and TSLA has shrugged off the MMD, it often has the ability to run upward and break into the green. At such times there is more worry about missing the bounce with Tesla than holding through a further dip. As the low volume afternoon hours approach, any excuse will likely lead to a short-seller-induced pushdown. In today's case, TSLA was trading quite a bit better than the macros going into the afternoon. The pushdown brought TSLA about even with the NASDAQ's decline, which made the push easier for the shorts. Beyond that number, the pushdown would have required more resources.

How do I know that the shorts have been manipulating TSLA hard this week? One indication is the icicles, the capping, and the low volume pushdowns into close. Another is the high volume in the final minute of market trading when short-selling manipulators can cover without affecting the stock price. Today's number was an enormous 524K shares traded in the final minute. We saw percent of selling by shorts run quite a bit higher today than yesterday, suggesting more manipulative selling and immediate covering, and we saw (according to Dusaniwsky below) over a million shares of TSLA added to short interest in the past few days. 



What's particularly interesting about the chart above is the quantity of short interest growth in the past few days when compared to the very mild decrease in the stock price over the same days. Interpretation? the shorts were trying like the mischief to push TSLA down and weren't getting much for their efforts. The bad news is that some of the shorting might just be a reasonable response to deteriorating macro conditions. The reasons for TSLA's resilience?
* Realization by some investors that the sugar-storm of media negativity and analyst negativity in past couple of weeks may indeed be a distortion of reality.
* A belief by many that Tesla's support at 180 will mark the bottom of the dip and a recovery can begin at or above this number

I tend to see the battle with the shorts as winnable at this point, but the boogyman continues to be macros and the carnage that new statements by the POTUS can have on the market. One needs to weigh both factors in investment decisions.



Short percentage of TSLA selling jumped higher today as shorts scrambled to push TSLA down with at least as much percent dip as the broader markets. Shorts were tagged with 45.5% of TSLA selling




Looking at the tech chart, you can see TSLA failing to establish a bottom yet but often running to or above 190 at some point during the day. Fear of missing the bounce seems to generate steeper climbs than fear of further drops tends to generate steep dips. At some point, after sufficient good news, TSLA could well break free of the capping and make a run for high numbers. We need that news, however. 

For the week, TSLA closed at 185.16, down 5.47 from last Friday's 190.63. That's a whole lot better than last week's 20.40 drop and with the full-court press of the media, certain analysts, and the shorts, it takes a week such as this one to pave the way for a bottom. Enjoy your weekend, shake off the stress, and enjoy life for a few days. You've earned it.

Conditions:
* Dow down 355 (1.41%)
* NASDAQ down 115 (1.51%)
* TSLA 185.16, down 3.06 (1.63%)
* TSLA volume 10M shares

The only thing I wanted was TACC
""

I was in the same boat: in Nov 2018 I wanted the car for the excellent driving dynamics and didn't care much for EAP. However, the thought that my $66.5K car will not be as relaxing on longer trips as modern cars many times cheaper, and of course FOMO, forced me to add the $5K EAP option. I'd have been very happy to pay $2K for what later became basic AP. I thought that EAP-or-nothing was a bad choice to win owners' trust and loyalty for Tesla. And because of that I will be more reluctant to bring more of my money to Tesla in the future. Tesla would erase the bad taste if they offer me to downgrade EAP->AP refunding $3K, or, perhaps, if they upgrade EAP->FSD for free so I have a fancier toy to play with.

Confused: How does this help me get a software update???? I have free charging at my building also.
""

Julian, clicking on Charge Complete in the Tesla App notifications does not help you get your software update sooner. The reason that I replied to you is that you need to turn on Charge Complete in the Tesla App. Here is the information from Tesla Support:

The Tesla app allows owners to remotely monitor their vehicle, alerting them when their charge is nearly complete and again once fully charged. For every additional minute a car remains connected to the Supercharger, it will incur an idle fee. If the car is moved within 5 minutes, the fee is waived. Idle fees apply when a Supercharger station is at least 50% full, and double when the station is 100% full. To be clear, this is purely about increasing customer happiness and we hope to never make any money from it.

In the US, the idle fee (per minute) for a SC that is 50% full is 50 cents per minute if you stay connected to the charger more than 5 minutes after you finish charging. If the SC is 100% full the idle fee (per minute) is $1.00 per minute for each minute you stay connected past the 5 minute grace period.

I am currently on 2019.16.2 and there are three releases newer than mine. Some of the releases like 2019.16.3.1 are only being installed in Australia. Unless you are in Australia, you will probably never receive this release. Most model 3, S, and Xs are currently on 2019.16.2. If your release is older that 2019.16.2, there is no way you can force the update. Telsa's that are connected to WiFi will get the new releases the soonest. Those that do not have WiFi will eventually get the new releases but they will wait longer to get the new release. If you are having a technical problem with you Tesla and you take it in for service, if there is a newer release, you can ask them to push the new release to your car. The new release will be available a few hours after they push the new release to your car.

Yeah, the nosecone. So in early model s builds(ones that have the nosecone), the battery pack is not well protected. If one cell is in short circuit, the BMS can easily lose control of its temperature and involve other cells, which might lead to smoke even fire, just like the Shanghai incident. And due to charging designs and safety designs in early model s, the use of a socket connector or a frontal crash may cause a short circuit in the cell. Tesla fixed the issue in model S built later (ones without the nosecone) but did not recall the early ones to fix it, maybe because of cost? Either way, if you take a look at all ""spontaneous fire"" incidents that involve a Tesla, it's an early model S. No other model has this issue.
As for the update, I don't approve how Tesla did it. Just like how I don't approve Windows 10 updates in the midst of my presentation. I certainly believe a notice is necessary.

I have a Telsa and a BMW currently. The former is on another level as far as sheer day-to-day driving enjoyment and overall technology. Just incredibly impressive. However the one time I've needed a replacement part (broken exterior mirror) it took 3+ weeks! A tech came to my house to install it and it was relatively inexpensive too, which helped but did not make up entirely for the fact I had to drive the car for 3 weeks without a mirror. Buying an inventory car was relatively painless for me but taking delivery was very quick, odd in many respects, and unprofessional.

The BMW customer service is pretty good and I can get nearly any part locally overnight if needed. Unfortunately the car is just not competitive with my Tesla. Not really even close IMO. The delivery experience was very professional and everything went in an expected way.

Unfortunately you can't get the best of everything and have to choose which is more important to you. For me the daily driving experience is most important as that's what I spend 99% of my time doing. If I spent 99% of my time dealing with Tesla Sales or Service I'd get a different car.

What I did not distinguish earlier is that this part of the manual and these conditions are not relevant to this situation, as the same logic does not apply for a Park to Drive transition. The factors above are to prevent rollaway, so they are for the situation where you have been driving, and you then take off your seatbelt, open the door, etc. -> the car shifts to park in that case, automatically, as soon as only one condition or fewer holds (You must have two of three conditions satisfied - door closed, seatbelt on, be in driver seat) to stay in drive. 

Anyway, summary, the above paragraph and the Owner's Manual information I quoted earlier is not relevant to this situation. 

My Test:

Without creep, without PIN to drive, Model 3, 2019.12.1.2:
1) Leaving my phone on the ground outside the car
2) I got in the car, being careful not to sit on the seat (I am physically capable of bracing myself this way)
3) Left the door open.
4) Did not put my seat belt on.
5) Pressed the brake pedal, and then pulled down to engage drive
6) Immediately, pushed the accelerator (but lightly). 

The car moved just fine. It is ready to roll.

Notable: If you DELAY pressing the accelerator for any appreciable time (a second or two) in this state, the car WILL automatically enter Park. The same happens with and without creep (but with creep of course it will creep forward a foot or so). But if you're quick with the accelerator application, it will go. 

I did not experiment with fast acceleration, for obvious reasons, for my test. 

I believe this is more than sufficient evidence to explain how this accident happened, and I think it is possible to have more aggressive safety interlocks from Tesla in this scenario. However, in the meantime, PIN to drive is a failsafe. 

Summary:

If you have very young kids, PLEASE turn on PIN to drive. Obviously this does not work for kids who will learn your PIN.",,0,0,0,0

Range charging is NEVER better for the battery. The CAC will change, but that is just a calculation and has absolutely noting to do with the range or performance of the car. The car will shut down when one of the brick voltages reaches the minimum value, regardless of what the CAC is. Unless you have some weak cells, you just need to keep it plugged in to keep it balanced. It will top off the charge and start balancing daily. I'm still waiting for someone with a declining 3.0 pack to run it all the way down to see what the actual range is. That would determine if this situation is software or actually a battery cell problem.

""

Exactly! For land transportation (cars and trucks) battery electric is far better. For trains, electric via overhead power lines is better. But for airplanes, weight is so critical that liquid hydrocarbons have an advantage in spite of the inefficiency of synthetic fuels. Freight and tanker ships, and even cruise ships, have no way to recharge batteries between ports, so there also the inefficient synthetic fuels are probably better than batteries. 

Again, petroleum is cheaper today, but that's only because of the subsidies and being allowed to use the atmosphere to dump their toxic waste.



buyer123456 said:
↑

If synthetic liquid hydrocarbon is economically and technically feasible, it will then sound like a better option than compressed H2 or batteries. 

So does it mean the billions of subsidies to H2 or batteries be redirected to synthetic hydrocarbon? Or at least new billions should be poured into synthetic liquid hydrocarbon R&D?
""

No, because as mentioned above, synthetic fuels are only better where weight is critical (airplanes) and places where charging is not available. For personal transportation on land batteries are far better than either H2 or synthetic fuels.

In fact, Jaguar don't use the full capacity of the battery to ensure it lasts longer by not letting you fully charge or discharge it, plus it has good thermal management.

That's partially true, however, Tesla's have custom made batteries and battery packs that they get from their GigaFactory, so they aren't the same as any other battery.

If you are charging and a Supercharger while on your trip, the Nav system may tell you that you only need X minutes of charge. The Tesla App will tell you that your charge has completed and you can resume your trip. If you cannot get back to your car in less than 5 minutes, restart the Supercharger by moving your state of charge to a higher percentage. This will keep you from being charged the idle fee. I normally do that every time I am traveling because I want and additional 20-30 miles more than the Nav system recommends.

You will use more energy than the Nav system predicts when you are driving into a strong headwind, driving when it is raining or snowing, climbing to higher altitude, or being rerouted due to an accident or a road closure. Extra energy in your battery is your friend. If you start running low on battery, the Nav system will tell you to slow down.

There was a pretty common conviction that demand is almost unlimited and that Tesla would get to 500K M3/year in a jiffy and then 1M, and then 2 and 3M is couple/few short years.

Now we know climb is not going to be that rapid. I actually don't think it will be much slower, but slower it will be. That changes everything as TSLA is value on growth rate.

Also, pivot to FSD story wasn't executed well as too much emphasize was on robotaxis, rather than partial FSD as driver of demand, and EM has lost credibility in terms of FSD timelines.

Having said all of that, I don't think it's half as bad as you think. I've been through massive drops of AMZN and NFLX and even FB, and once sentiment changes, SP takes care of itself rapidly. This is how I lost positions in those companies, as SP was rising massively and my covered calls got me caught. That's why I often liken covered calls to picking pennies in front of the steamroller.

Technically yes it was a bubble and kind of still is. But most tech stocks are. It’s a speculative investment. You have to make assumptions to have a bullish view on TSLA at this market cap. Tesla is a promising investment because the cars are like no other. I don’t think another brand can replicate it. 

The main worry is Elon making promises of profitability from Q3 2018 onward, then with very short notice announcing a monstrous loss in Q1 and a loss in Q2 (even with record deliveries). The biggest mistake is promising profitability, because now the company will be judged based on that awesome Q3 instead of market share growth and innovation. 

Also, Elon’s credibility has been lost with many institutions due to multiple SEC mishaps, missed timelines and silly childish tweets (which I think are a positive but to WS bankers? Nah)

My summary: power-to-CH4 is less efficient than power-to-H2. But we already have significant infrastructure to store and transport methane, and to generate electricity from it.

Technically yes it was a bubble and kind of still is. But most tech stocks are. It’s a speculative investment. You have to make assumptions to have a bullish view on TSLA at this market cap. Tesla is a promising investment because the cars are like no other. I don’t think another brand can replicate it.

The main worry is Elon making promises of profitability from Q3 2018 onward, then with very short notice announcing a monstrous loss in Q1 and a loss in Q2 (even with record deliveries). The biggest mistake is promising profitability, because now the company will be judged based on that awesome Q3 instead of market share growth and innovation.

Also, Elon’s credibility has been lost with many institutions due to multiple SEC mishaps, missed timelines and silly childish tweets (which I think are a positive but to WS bankers? Nah)

The more interesting question is:



JetFalcon said:
↑

The Lamborghini was cool, but if I had to own it and drive it everyday, I don't think I could do it. The car is very loud, you must be very attentive driving it, and it's a rough car in general. With the Tesla Roadster being electric, could this be more comfortable compared to most exotics gas based cars?
""

For whatever it's worth, I've owned a Lotus Esprit V8 and a 1st gen Tesla Roadster (or R1 as I think of it). My experience with the Lotus was just like what you describe. The Lotus was loud and rough and fun to drive fast on the open road, not so fun to drive slowly around town. The Roadster is happy to go fast and happy to go slow, and it's a great freeway warrior. Taking the top off and just cruising around is great fun and relaxing; it's like sailing. However, I must admit it's not so relaxing to drive long distances at highway speed because of the road noise, wind noise (esp with the soft top) and the taut suspension and steering.

There's a lot we don't know for sure about the new Roadster (R2), how it will be tuned, what kind of suspension it will have, and so forth. We can only speculate. However, my best guess is that it should be more of a grand touring car than something optimized only for running hot laps. My reasoning follows. . .

With 200 KWh of batteries, it's gonna be too massive to truly excel at clawing through apexes. I'm sure the low CG will help, and torque vectoring will help, but the laws of physics are still what they are. Don't pick a fight you can't win.

Accleration specs aside, the design doesn't look like a hardcore track car. It's got plenty of trunk space, and it has back seats, and the styling just doesn't look ultra-aggressive. At the unveiling Elon was careful to point out that it's a ""real car"" that you can take road trips in. That implies to me that there should be some thought given to smoothness and comfort.

This is one reason I'm eager to learn more about the Model S ""Raven"" adaptive suspension system. Something like that might possibly make its way into the Roadster. Then you could dial it soft for a road trip or cruising around town, or dial it hard for track day or canyon carving.",,1,0,0,0

I think this photo tells all. It shows the head of UI development Pawel Pietryka doing work on an MS/MX MCU on a bench. Not in an actual driving car. Just as we always suspected. Complete disconnect from an actual driving UX. Which is ironic, because this is his exact quote: “Everyone knows good design needs to be functional, simple, intuitive. But more than anything it needs to deliver a great user experience.” Yeah, a great UX --- as long as you're driving a desk.

""

This explains why the visual display of each version since version 7 has deteriorated. Version 8 and version 9 UI is unreadable IMO by anyone over the age of 45-50. In version 7, the UI used colors that were selected to contrast with the background. Easy to read. In version 8 Tesla went to a grayish foreground color for all text on a grayish-white background. Very difficult to read while driving at highway speeds. Even something as simple as reading the clock is very difficult. Version 9 is even harder to read than version 8. This is not an insignificant issue but a major safety issue. In version 7, I could read everything on both screens. Now I have to look, look and look at the screens to try to figure out street names, distances to turns, battery level at arrival at destination, etc. Any tine you have to do more than take a quick glance, it becomes a safety issue.

I did write to Tesla about this, however I believe the screen appearance (eg, text color and background color) will not improve until such time as Elon and/or the software designers reach mid-age and start having visual issues from normal aging.

As for the OP, he is NOT saying he wants anything for free, nor is he saying he refuses to accept a software update. He is simply stating that if an update is absolutely necessary for some reason, one should be notified of the need for the update and when it will occur. That is a fair request. And further, a software update should improve the user’s experience or keep the experience the same, and not degrade that experience.",,0,0,0,0

The main worry is Elon making promises of profitability from Q3 2018 onward, then with very short notice announcing a monstrous loss in Q1 and a loss in Q2 (even with record deliveries). The biggest mistake is promising profitability, because now the company will be judged based on that awesome Q3 instead of market share growth and innovation.

Also, Elon’s credibility has been lost with many institutions due to multiple SEC mishaps, missed timelines and silly childish tweets (which I think are a positive but to WS bankers? Nah)
""

This!

Elon is sometimes his own downfall.

Just to comment further:
I don’t understand how some people can defend Musk’s constant blabbering of wildly inaccurate timeline estimates as being good for goal setting purposes. If it’s known by the masses that you have to add several months at least to anything he predicts, something is not right. These estimates are used by the markets in their valuation models. It doesn’t help TSLA investors when you’re off almost all the time, and when you predict a net profit by a specific quarter and then later say it will end up being a loss.

1) I did email [email protected]. They didn’t respond for over a week, and then immediately responded after I mentioned I had emailed them to another Tesla Support Employee. Their advice was to take my car in to service and have them address the issue, along with s page of instructions on how to make a service appointment via the phone app. Gee, thanks for that. Of course my car has already been seen by service multiple times, and their advice was to keep doing the “double forced firmware update” to resuscitate the MCU, and eventually replace the MCU for $2400 when that stopped working. Even though that replacement MCU would be subject to the same issue.

2) The solution: After seeking the help of several TMC users on chip replacement, I was directed to @tedsk, who is near me on the East Coast and had the bandwidth to help. He recommended I send him the MCU, and he could replace the chip and transfer my old data to the new chip. If I wanted anything bigger than the original 8GB chip, I would need to provide it, but he would install it. He said it would be done in about a week.

3) I brought my car in to the local Service Center, and let them try the “double forced firmware update” to revive the black MCU. It took them a day, but it worked. They charged me $175 for the labor, a price we had agreed upon up front, only to be paid if the attempts were successful. Since removing the MCU is a fairly complex task, I asked them to sell me the LTE connectivity upgrade ($500), which includes full MCU removal. Prior to doing the LTE board swap, I asked them to let me have the MCU, so I could Fedex it down to Tedsk for the eMMC chip upgrade.

4) After reading several threads here and on the DIYElectricCars forum, I thought that upgrading to a 64GB was ideal, and that we should leave 32GB unpartitioned. Turns out I may have misunderstood some of those threads, as the 64GB chip was only suggested for MCU2 and newer. So Tedsk and I decided on a 16GB chip instead for my first gen MCU, leaving 8GB unpartitioned. Thanks @verygreen for input here.

5) Tedsk managed to turn the whole thing around in under two days, and Fedexed the MCU back up to me over the long weekend. I just got the car back from Tesla Service today, after they completed the LTE upgrade. So far, everything looks good. The browser actually works again, which hasn’t been the case in many months. I am hoping I won’t have any further MCU issues, now that we have a much more robust eMMC chip in place. I did have to reprogram my driver profiles and Homelinks, because we intentionally dropped personal data from the old chip so as not to carry forward any corruption, as a precaution.

Here is the link to the chip I used:

SFEM016GB1EA1TO-I-GE-111-STD Swissbit | Mouser

Note that if anyone with a failing MCU2 needs the 64GB eMMC chip, I have a spare now, just PM me if you want it.

Thank you so much Tedsk, you and your services were an absolute lifesaver! Even after paying around $50 in shipping each way plus the LTE upgrade, I still ended up spending less than half the $2400 that Tesla wanted me to pay to replace the MCU. And now with the bigger and more robust chip, I should be protected from future issues caused by excessive logging to the eMMC!",,0,0,0,0

I've removed many panels over the years as a DIY'er. The plastic clips every manufacturer uses seem to hold the panels slightly less tight after going through a removal/reinstall cycle. I learned early on to replace all of them when you take a panel off. It avoids the worst case scenario of getting a rattle and having to pull it again just to replace one or more clips. Also, they can be rather fragile, so one or more are likely to break when coming off. You need to have a couple spares on hand for that situation anyway.

This is an area of nuance which depends on the state and the utility. My utility is PG&E in Northern California. If PG&E is also your energy provider (ie. you didn't sign up with a DA provider or CCA) then they will only issue a check if you are a net generator. That means that at the end of the year you exported more kWh to the grid than you consumed from the grid. It is possible to have a couple hundred dollar credit balance due to TOU differentials on retail energy prices and have it wiped out because you were not a net generator. The Net Surplus Compensation for net surplus kWh is ""wholesale"" at about 3.5c/kWh.
On the other hand, if you are on a CCA (Community Choice Aggregation) then they have their own policies for the generation portion of the bill that they handle. Most will actually cut you a check for credit balances based on retail generation rates whether you are a net surplus generator or not. PG&E will still wipe out your credit balance on the transmission and distribution part of your bill at true-up and of course you have to pay the minimum delivery charges of ~$10/mo every month as well.
""

Thanks for the feedback.

Arbitrary numbers below conceptually reflecting actual bill at annual settlement. Are my calculations and conclusions correct?

TOU: Yes
Total @ consumer rate: -$500
Net Surplus: -2000 kWh (generation to grid)
Net Surplus Compensation @ 0.04: $80 (2000 * 0.04)
Monthly Mandatory Charge for 12 months @ $10/month: $120

- Total annual liability to my utility is $40 (120 - 80).
- Size of total consumer rate, if reflecting a credit, is irrelevant to my bottom line.
- Should target to have a Net Surplus to cover the mandatory charge.
- For simplicity, self-powered mode, is the ""better"" option given difference in consumer rate I pay and the surplus rate paid by my utility.",,0,0,0,0

Tesla promised a $35,000 car. It was very difficult to keep that price for 2 months then it went up to $35,400. It's unlikely by introducing Model Y, there's any possibility of selling $35,000 car even for 2 months!

Tesla wanted to pilot a simple manufacturing process. The smaller, the simpler, the better.

It's possible to do the Y first, but that would make the preparation for a first simple manufacturing process harder and most likely would delay a first production after Roadster, S, and X.

3710505,"I stared down Lane Departure Assist, and it BLINKED",SammichLover,2019-05-31 18:08:00,"First off; All this happened on a closed course is Mexico, so we don't need to hear any chatter about that.

So yesterday I felt empathy for @AlanSubie4Life , who's vehicle is currently on 2019.12.1. He's torn about whether on not to update or not, he's got a patch downloaded and primed I think? There's all this ickiness with the 16.X patch clustergrab, and one of the things in question is whether 16.X will somehow scream at you like a banshee, as 8.6.1 did. So I offered to help him out by doing some detailed poking at LDA (which I'd turned off, I believe, prior to 16.X, and definitely have been driving without on 16.X).

First thing I did was turn off most of the toggles off, including ELDA (which I always turn off each drive, anyway) to make sure there wasn't any confusion or question about whether it was behind something that happened (as its exact behavior is opaque still). The only one I left on was Emergency Braking.

Next, I went out on a wide, modern 5 lane road (on a closed course in Mexico) that has 2 lanes each way and a shared lane down the middle used as a turning lane, but has no medians or actual barriers on it. Earlier there was a lot of other vehicles running on this closed course, so I was pretty limited in what I could poke at. I did find though that I couldn't get the Warning setting for LDA to make even a peep, or pop an error message. Just does that annoying little wheel shake, that I could easily mistake as very worn out rumble strips. If I was actually out of it enough that I wasn't paying attention I could probably miss that it was there, as it doesn't last that long and then its gone. It manages to be both annoying AND useless, in my books, which is quite the feat. 

Moving on from that mini-screed; I switched to Assist, and this I found more interesting. And annoying....but that's not what this post is about. Bad SM, bad!  Where was I? Oh right, the interesting part is that with the very limiting environment I wasn't able to check it out that much but I was able to get it to beep and pop up an error message once. I had a hunch what did it but really couldn't investigate safely, on this crowed closed course in Mexico.

Well about an hour ago a lot of people had left the track and gone home for their bowls of pozole (mmmm, pozole) or whatever. I had a lot more room to poke at LDA and stretch it out some. I was able to confirm that if you let LDA correct your path twice in succession it will beep once and throw up a warning message to take control of your life. Or the wheel, I forget the exact text. Didn't have anyone with me to snap pictures. But it gets better. If you continue to only provide very, very slight correction to the wheel and get LDA to trigger multiple times in succession it gets progressively insistent that you need to take some control of the situation.

Eventually, face with enough indifference from the driver, it'll beep a lot and then start to flash blue at the top left of the screen like if you're in AP. Then, it'll turn on the 4-way flashers! That's where I bailed out on the test, still a few too many fine folks at the closed course in Mexico to feel comfortable pushing it further than that. No need to get them all confused about why the gringo is driving just under the speed limit with his 4-ways flashing. 

Keep in mind this was happening with manual speed control. What I want to test next is to see what will happen with TACC engaged, if LDA will disengage that, and at what point. Then what will happen, with so further input coming in. I'd like to check CC, too, but obviously I can't do that as (AFAIK) you can't degrade enabled TACC to CC on a Model 3.

The reason to favor the X over the S is the sales numbers. The X outsells the S. The X's more upright seating position makes it easier to get in and out of than the S. My 60-something back really appreciates this. And then when I sit, having a bend in my knees is more comfortable than having legs straight out, and also better for my aching back.

And for younger people with families, the X is a better fit. Taking the kids to a from that quintessential soccer game is easier with an X, and there is more room to stow the associated gear like folding chairs and tables, awnings, and ice chests.

This is obviously the way American tastes are going and is the reason Ford and now GM are killing most sedans in favor of SUV/CUVs.

Tesla, IMHO, made a serious mistake with the 3 and Y. They should have brought out the Y first. As it is now, Tesla is suffering the Osborne effect from the Y announcements. With potential 3 buyers (younger people, especially families, with less disposable income) holding onto their money knowing the Y is coming, instead of buying the 3. Hopefully Tesla will survive this major screw up, but if not, at least the cause of death will not be hard to determine.

I bought my 2018 S P100D as new inventory in March for $76k after tax incentive. There were several of us around the same time. You can probably get a new one with an incentive and the free lifetime supercharging if you watch the inventory search sites in the next few weeks.

The best deals tend to go fast but usually appear 3-4 weeks from quarter end. I tended to check everyday a bit after midnight and the cars were usually gone by noon. The lowest I found was about $73k after federal tax incentive. If you find one you like, consider ordering it and paying the $2,500 right away or someone else might snag it out from under you while you think about it. The order and fee are refundable.

They might have already gone through the big inventory purge though. Many of the discounted P100D were from stores that were closing and were probably clearing them for the new Raven showroom cars.

3710537,"Tesla, TSLA & the Investment World: the 2019 Investors' Roundtable",TMThree,2019-05-31 18:25:00,"I was just thinking about how Apple wanted to buy Tesla years ago at $240. They required Musk be removed as a condition. That's why the deal never went though.

With the cash reserves Apple has, they could short Tesla all the way down to $150, where Musk's own shares get liquidated: 

To support funding the company and other personal investments over the last decade, Musk personally borrowed about $517 million on margin from Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, and Bank of America by pledging his Tesla share holdings as collateral.

Normally, Elon Musk could just borrow more money on margin to buy Tesla stock and push the price back up. But due to Musk having a series of problems with the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) about the validity of his optimistic tweets, coupled with a video surfacing of him brazenly smoking pot, Tesla’s Board restricted Musk to a 25 percent “loan to pledge” on his stock ownership.

As a result, another 20 percent decline in Tesla stock price to about $151.53, may cause Elon Musk’s lenders to start massive sales of Tesla’s stock to protect the principal of their margin loans. Such big sales could kick off a shareholder panic and cause the price to crash​
Doing this would get them a cheaper buyout price AND get rid of Musk in one fell swoop. And by doing it right now, max FUD can be pushed because it will be at least till Q3 results that Tesla has any chance of showing significant sales metrics to combat the shorters. Even China gigafactory won't have results for maybe 8-12 months from now.",,0,0,0,0

I don't see anyone mentioning why these car makers are investing in Hydrogen.

One reason is that the battery manufacturing ramp up is very slow. It will take 40-50 years to replace all gasoline cars with BEVs because there won't be enough batteries available.
Second, energy storage of renewables can not be solved by batteries in large scale. Even the day/night demand and production swing is difficult to solve with batteries, let alone seasonal swings. Hydrogen however is a good alternative, can store energy for months.

I see some people mentioning H2 is leaking but that's not true any more. Unless you are talking about the 1% per month leakage.

China is investing heavily in Hydrogen. And most other countries make steps as well. Elon Musk calls them fool cells for marketing reasons. Fools are the ones repeating him.

The reason to favor the X over the S is the sales numbers. The X outsells the S. The X's more upright seating position makes it easier to get in and out of than the S. My 60-something back really appreciates this. And then when I sit, having a bend in my knees is more comfortable than having legs straight out, and also better for my aching back.

And for younger people with families, the X is a better fit. Taking the kids to a from that quintessential soccer game is easier with an X, and there is more room to stow the associated gear like folding chairs and tables, awnings, and ice chests.

This is obviously the way American tastes are going and is the reason Ford and now GM are killing most sedans in favor of SUV/CUVs.

Tesla, IMHO, made a serious mistake with the 3 and Y. They should have brought out the Y first. As it is now, Tesla is suffering the Osborne effect from the Y announcements. With potential 3 buyers (younger people, especially families, with less disposable income) holding onto their money knowing the Y is coming, instead of buying the 3. Hopefully Tesla will survive this major screw up, but if not, at least the cause of death will not be hard to determine.

The X will almost certainly be refreshed. Tesla is doing the refresh to boost sales, but they are also doing it to make parts as common as possible across all the cars. The latter is a big cost savings for them.

I’m gonna throw out a guess that they announce the refreshed car two weeks or so into Q2. This will prevent anyone using their seven day return policy from the end of Q1 and people with the old car will be somewhat pleased that they got in on the tax credit.

The new cars will be announced with a higher MSRP and a 3-style interior for September deliveries. This would clear out any existing S/X inventory for customers who want the “classic” layout and lower price.

This strategy would create plenty of classic S/X sales for Q2, get the market primed for the new version, and give Wall Street something to shut them up. All right in time to knock the Taycan and EQC down a few pegs during their launches.

We'll disagree on that count...witness pin to drive. They've clearly established many lockout mechanisms for folks to employ if they feel unsafe with the car in the default state. They cannot be blamed if folks choose not to employ them.

On the other hand, if their literature is incorrect or even misleading to the majority...well that's a different story.

The whole purpose of this post this to convey that folks have a responsibility to operate their dangerous property with full knowledge and foresight of how variables could result in an undesirable outcome. It's the same with a stove, lawnmower, or chainsaw. As someone else here mentioned, there is, of course, a reasonableness limit to this. No one would permit a vehicle that could be touched from the exterior with no key or other pre-existing conditions to launch itself at great speed. But this is not what we're talking about. 

We're talking about a car that has conditions that need to be met in order to operate, and the mother should have absolutely familiarised herself with those before letting her child anywhere near the front seat. And please don't give me the excuse that she wasn't aware of where the child was, because I intimately understand how a parent's sense of perception works with young children. You may not always be reading fine detail of their actions, but you're hyper aware of their general location and disposition.

Don't get me wrong, there is certainly some level of ""reasonable"" that needs to be established when you're ""reinventing the wheel"" (just like my gripes of the car auto locking itself when I get out), so I can absolutely see Tesla settling this one even if the woman is ultimately culpable, but it doesn't excuse her actions one bit.

Correct, I am financing. I have good credit, I just thought it would be easier for the purchase to go through tesla's financing and if i didnt like their terms i could go to a CU or bank? Is that realistic?

Last time I bought a car was 7 years ago and i paid cash so I am pretty unfamiliar with the financing process altogether
""

You may be thinking like a traditional dealership, where you get your pre approval through the dealership, and then decide what you want to do (and they try to convert you to a better rate on site or something).

Not sure about tesla financing, but if you are not financing through tesla, you are effectively paying cash.... just with some combination of your cash and the bank / credit union you choose cash. For tesla its a cash purchase.

If you are going through their financing, your down payment will be subject to whatever terms they have laid out for you based on your credit score and debt to income ratio... just like any other bank.

Most peoples recommendation here would be to go to outside financing (check where you bank for example if they provide good rates). In december when I got mine, I put a very large down payment down, but because I decided on the performance model 3 I could not pay for it all in cash, so financed part of it with my credit union (navy federal). I got 3.59% for 72 months which was pretty good at that time, especially for that term. I doubt I am going to take the amount i borrowed to 72 months but I have the option to if I want, and I dont feel bad about it since I put like 70% down.

Anyway, it was easy to get approved through my credit union for the amount, pick up a bank check, and fill it out at the tesla delivery center. They knew exactly how to process it, and they had no issue taking a personal check from me for the part I paid myself and didnt finance.

Your terms should be in your account.. and if you want to roll the 1200 delivery fee and tax and stuff in there, just tell them (provided you can absorb that in the debt to income ratio etc. As you surmise, that is likely the difference in your figures and theirs.

... energy storage of renewables can not be solved by batteries in large scale.
""

For my house alone, I am having solar installed along with two Powerwalls, since the local utility will not buy my excess daytime generation. The payback is estimated at around 5 or 6 years. It's true that conversion is a slow process. But batteries can be produced at the same rate as the solar panels. So H2 is really no solution at all.

I think the reason the legacy carmakers are pushing it is to greenwash the fact that they've chosen not to be serious about BEVs (except for Nissan). And because Tesla has such a head start on BEV technology that it pretty much owns the market. The impracticality of HFC cars is seen in the fact that they're selling them at an enormous loss and giving away the H2 and giving away free car rental. For 21 days. One review said the Clarity HFC does 0-60 in 9 seconds. That's pretty respectable, though it's almost double the time of the slowest trim line of the Model 3.

If we continue to burn fossil fuels for the next 50 or 60 years at the rate we're doing now (and it's actually going to increase as the developing nations build their economies) we're going to turn this planet into Venus.

The ""being close to the cars you are attemping to park in between"" is the big one. The autopark ALWAYS makes a 3 point reverse park. If you were parking yourself, you likely are far enough away to reverse into it in one go (if you back in all the time). The car always fully cuts the wheel, gets really close to one of the cars on the side, then stops, then pulls forward, then backs in (for perpendicular parking).

Also as mentioned there MUST be 2 cars there. You cant park between 1 car and a blank space, or 1 car and a curb / island for perpendicular parking), I have not done parallel parking because I dont park on the street if I can avoid it, even if I have to park further or pay to park instead... so I am usually able to avoid parking on the street where parallel parking normally occurs where I am.",,0,0,0,0

I don't have any kind of AP. I don't have parking sensors. I don't have navigation or estimated SOC on arrival. I don't have user profiles or seat memory. There is absolutely nothing that would improve in my car if it had V9.

I very often use the map + and - controls, but with V9 they always disappear. I keep the map on the bottom in V8 both so the buttons don't disappear and because it's easier to reach the map controls.

I had a loaner for 2 weeks with V9. It had the steering wheel heater so I tried it out. But it was not too cold in the car so I turned off climate control. How many clicks to turn off the wheel? 1) climate button 2) elements tab 3) wheel off 4) climate tab since it turned climate on 5) climate off. That's a lot of distracted driving.

IMO the biggest issue with V9 is the additional interaction required to do tasks that were simpler before. Everything I often control while driving requires more clicks - except selecting the media app, which still takes one click just like mine. Smaller controls just add to the problem.

Agree with @HankLloydRight - V9 is more dangerous to interact with while driving. Even after two weeks with it my driving was still impaired due to the UI demanding so much more attention. It was frustrating and embarrassing.",,0,0,0,0

I don't really follow your thinking. People have been buying cars from the big iron companies for many decades. The Japanese showed us all how to make reliable cars and now literally every significant car company in the world makes similar products that they sell the same way to the same people. Clearly there is no problem with the greater auto industry in being able to sell cars to the masses. They didn't sell electric cars because they are much more conservative than a silicon valley start up company and typically would stick their toe in the water first. Tesla did what they said they were going to do, spur the advancement of EVs. 

Now every major car company is pushing ahead to produce EVs. These companies are well capitalized, have good engineering and most importantly know exactly how to sell cars to the public. That is why they will have many models and market them through advertising and display them in their showrooms. They will sell to the other 99%. If Tesla wants to be able to compete in 100% of the market space, they will need to do a lot that they just aren't capable of doing. Having service centers 200 miles apart won't cut it. Having crowding at their chargers won't cut it. Continually cutting back on service and support won't cut it. 

To compare this to selling cell phones is rather disingenuous. Cell phones are inexpensive items that are all about the tech and the glitter. The glitter and tech in autos may attract people to showrooms, but in reality they want transportation. The big iron companies know how to deliver that. Apple virtually invented the smart phone. They didn't start out with a tiny share of the market with enormous barriers to ramping up production. As I put this down in writing, I realize I've been fooling myself into thinking Tesla has much chance to make it in the long haul. They will never have dealers or repair centers in small cities or towns. They will likely never complete the network of superchargers enough to eliminate the crowding and long lines in key areas. They will never have enough models to effectively compete with the big iron. There is a reason why there have been no successful automotive startups in how many decades.",,0,0,0,0

Throughout my business life I've watched those with financial interests ever narrow the scope of performance and return such that we are almost at a quarterly (or even shorter) outlook. This has had at least two impacts. First, long term interests are not part of the strategy or even considered allowing for short term value extraction at the expense of functionality and viability. Second, management is ever more laser focused on getting in, driving profits up and getting out while reaping their own reward. You see this in the divergence of employee/CEO pay.

Business is indeed loosing their ability to think. That is what is so refreshing about Musk but he is fighting an uphill battle.

As for Mueller, rules are rules and there is a lot to be said for playing by them. The President ""owns"" the Department of Justice. Just watching the Senate allow that clown Barr to be installed should tell you as much. Saying the JD should deal with a corrupt President simply does not make any sense which makes Mueller's position the only viable one.

The problem you are really having is that Congress was incompetent prior to Trump coming along and, when you need them to be competent, there is really no one at home. We have changed the way we hire. The job candidates we are getting reflect this change in hiring practices. Old mantra but we are the ones that need to change when it comes to playing by the rules and not Mueller who is actually playing by the rules.

I think buying an RWD drive car in our climate is simply irresponsible. Learn from my mistake - the fact you are even asking makes me know you already know the answer.
""

Sorry, the Tesla ain't a BMW. The perfect weight balance, never needing to shift gears, instantaneous response of an electric drivetrain, heavy weight, low centre of gravity and amazing traction control sets the RWD Tesla in an entirely different league from the BMW. The RWD BMW compares to three RWD Tesla driving in winter as a 70's muscle car trying to come to an emergency stop on wet pavement compares to a modern BMW with ABS. 
If you need to get going from a stop on ice while on an incline, or like to accelerate as rapidly as possible from every stop light/sign you'll wish you had AWD. The rest of the time you'll never miss the AWD. I was worried at first, but now am so happy I got the extra range rather than the AWD. My bank account is happier too. 
The one consideration is that today the LR is only available in the SR and SR+. My worst efficiency in the highway was with a cold battery with the roof box on, driving in the Rockies with a full load of people and gear and a roof box on at -28C. My Wh/km was twice the rated Wh/km, meaning my range was halved. Driving in the mountains, in winter, at -28C with my family in the car is not a time when I want to be concerned with range anxiety! When they quote 386 km range, consider having 20% to spare and energy consumption doubled, and now your worst case range is only about 150 to 160 km.
Screen shots below are for the worst efficiency I got as well as my total energy usage from the time I installed my winter tires until I took them off.",,0,0,0,0

They would be wrong. Not sure what you mean by battery farms ""that keep burning energy"" since they do no such thing. Of course hydrogen wastes energy in it's production and storage since it takes energy to produce, compress, and it leaks out of holding tanks.

Actually the pilots could shut it off but were not properly trained on the procedure. The MCAS software implementation was just one of a few fails on the part of Boeing, but it mainly fell on a lack of training on the new system. Pilots didn’t know or were unfamiliar with how the software operated and fought it when it was activated thinking the plane was malfunctioning. This caused a loop of sorts where the pilot would try and force the plane up and the software in turn thought the Angle of Attack was to great and therefore pushed the nose down. If there had been training implemented there would not have been a problem. Also aTesla crash will not kill 300+ people.
""

This is perhaps off topic, so I will only say this. The Ethiopian Airline pilots knew how to shut down the MCAS and the audio shows they tried to do that. But it still wasn't enough for them to regain control of the flight. The MCAS problem has a term I don't recall, but the response they were trained in is to shut off all automatic trim and operate it manually in situations like this. We will know more when they have completed the analysis and make it public.",,0,0,0,0

Yes, exactly. h.264 on hw2.5 and h.265 on hw3.

“Running 2019.16.2 on a Model 3, Apple QuickTime's ""Movie Inspector"" shows H.264 (not H.265) format on TeslaCam files still within the .mp4 container.

Perhaps this format change was present earlier, then pulled, or was on an experimental firmware branch.
I have since learned that this change isn't about what software version you're on, but rather if you have HW2 or HW3. It seems that cars with HW3 are the ones that are encoding to H.265/HEVC - several people across different online discussions have confirmed this (although I know the plural of anecdotes is not ""data"").

Maybe this is the first concrete indicator (besides build date) to determine if you have HW3 or not?‘
""

Well, again we are just guessing, just like any cars built after April is HW3 which may be proven wrong
Maybe the encoding is based on software version.
HW3 is supposed to be only used for Autopilot and FSD so why would it be needed for sentry videos to encode at H265?
If it turns out that HW3 is needed for H265 encoding then that proves that not having HW3 is a big minus because it could be required for other updates and features!",,0,0,0,0

Last time I looked, batteries were only a small portion of total lithium use - more was being used as a medicine, actually. That may have changed.

There's more of an argument for Cobalt limits, but there are chemistry options to avoid it. 

More importantly, if the battery industry gets that kind of money behind it, you'll see a bunch more battery R&D efforts. Things that have been quietly percolating away in labs like solid state cells and Magnesium Ion (twice the charge) may emerge into the market place.

They're evaluating all cost savings possible. The homelink isn't cheap from any mfger, and $300 is cheaper than most vehicles charge for it. Not everyone needs it, not everyone has a garage or gate. It makes sense to make it optional and they benefit from raising margins.

While that's true, there is a tipping point where we will face a shortage of chargers. Tesla is currently delivery 80 cars per day in Vancouver. It's great! But if people aren't willing to fork $$ for home charging upgrades, the public/paid ones will get full quickly. Tesla in the US is already restricting how much you can charge on their superchargers to get more cars in.

Yes, I expect there will be a continuing dynamic between chargers and EV drivers looking for charging. I’m seeing Leafs pretty much every day on the Island along with some other BEVs. But most often I see the chargers empty. GVA might be different. Even at that, I expect that as demand for chargers increases, supply will also increase. 

Even at that, I think that many potential BEV purchasers would respond to a $5,000 to $10,000 incentive to abandon ICE in favour of BEV and few would factor in a few hundred dollars toward a private charger. Again, I think if there were to be any incentive money for chargers, it should be delivered to “the best bang” which I think would be increasing the number of publicly available chargers.",,0,0,0,0

Are you aware that version 9 introduced a comparability issue between Superchargers and the 2012 and 2013 cars? Search for it here on TMC. At least one owner got stranded at Supercharger locations that had the earliest manufactured chargers. If I remember correctly, one person had to be towed to the Tesla Service center more than once because the car could not charge at the Supercharger once version 9 was installed. I also recall that other owners of 2012 and 2013 cars had similar issues. It took Tesla many months to resolve the problem.

No one is saying don’t create updates. No one is saying give me something for free. The OP is just asking to be told the update will be installed on his car beforehand so he doesn’t come out to the car and be surprised. I can’t believe you would be against such notice.

Further, I believe it is reasonable to expect that an update is not gonna “break” something. Let Tesla develop whatever updates they want and/or need to do. But is it unreasonable to expect that, for example, said update employs foreground and background colors that are similar and lack sufficient contrast so as to render the information shown on the screens unreadable to at least a certain percentage of owners (which owners likely made a purchase decision when the car had a UI that was easily readable)? Or, how would you feel if you were stranded at a place far from home because an update prevented you from charging your car? I would be upset and I imagine you would be too.

I don’t think anyone is suggesting that no updates ever be made. The OP just wanted to be notified before it was forcibly installed on his car.

And I would like any updates to provide easily readable text and fonts on the screens, as existed in versions 6 and 7. Tesla provided such an easily readable UI in versions up to version 8. There is no reason they needed to “break” that readability other than the UI in versions 8 and 9 was designed by twenty something year olds that have “perfect” eyesight and can not imagine their color selections causing older individuals difficulty. One thing is certain, if you don’t die prematurely (I’m not wishing that to anyone), you will find your ability to distinguish text in foreground color “A” on a background color “B” to change as you age.

Updating without warning is unacceptable.
V9 is incredibly bad.

I don't have any kind of AP. I don't have parking sensors. I don't have navigation or estimated SOC on arrival. I don't have user profiles or seat memory. There is absolutely nothing that would improve in my car if it had V9.

I very often use the map + and - controls, but with V9 they always disappear. I keep the map on the bottom in V8 both so the buttons don't disappear and because it's easier to reach the map controls.

I had a loaner for 2 weeks with V9. It had the steering wheel heater so I tried it out. But it was not too cold in the car so I turned off climate control. How many clicks to turn off the wheel? 1) climate button 2) elements tab 3) wheel off 4) climate tab since it turned climate on 5) climate off. That's a lot of distracted driving.

IMO the biggest issue with V9 is the additional interaction required to do tasks that were simpler before. Everything I often control while driving requires more clicks - except selecting the media app, which still takes one click just like mine. Smaller controls just add to the problem.

Agree with @HankLloydRight - V9 is more dangerous to interact with while driving. Even after two weeks with it my driving was still impaired due to the UI demanding so much more attention. It was frustrating and embarrassing.
""

How many clicks to control interior temp? How many clicks to turn on recirculate or biohazard mode on? To pick a streaming favorite? To pick a favorite destination? That’s about all I do with the UI while driving.

For my money, log scale is the best way compare exponential growth. It also helps to look at incremental volume (differences) as opposed to cumulative volume (levels). So it look like solar is nearly beating wind in incremental volume. Wind of course has a substantial lead in cumulative volume, but I do believe solar will eventually catch up on that basis.

It is costing Tesla money - the very money exchanged for the car at purchase.

Nobody is asking for something free, just what was paid for.
""

Man. I'm really surprised by the backlash I'm getting. And I refuse to back down. You exchanged money for a device. You are now the owner of a device. Hack it. Burn it to the ground. Drive it off a cliff. It is your device. No one else is obligated to help you or provide you any service. If you would like to use a service (the warranty, the LTE, the maps, the music) then you enter into a contract. In this case a contract between the owner of a vehicle and its manufacturer. That agreement is bilateral and requires both parties to hold up their respective ends of the deal. The owners end is that Tesla can basically use the data they collect for any purpose and alter the software in the car any way they see fit. You get all the cool stuff that literally no other car company in the world provides (see earlier list). If you want V8 or V5 or Ubuntu or make your car into a sculpture; cool. If you want to drive your car will all those cool service based features, then you need to accept they are going to alter the software on your car as they see fit.

The issue seems to be related to feature extraction (computing edges, corners, blobs, ridges) and may be a problem at lower levels during image acquisition time where the camera has a hard time differentiating the sky from the white panels of the truck.

Although not directly related, the human brain compensates for holes in its vision all of the time, and we don't even realize it unless we test it in particular ways. Here is an example:

Presumably, as things progress, the NN should eventually be able to be trained and compensate for holes (occlusions) in its sensor data, so perhaps there are several ways to address this phenomenon.

Hello Pandap. 
You are right, pricing saying ""from"" is just a rough estimate. Difference of our $250 compare to $597 at the other shop probably means different options for tinting like type of film, brand, size etc. 
Same idea with the chrome delete. It can be done as 100% wrapped, or 50%/50% wrapped and painted etc.Then mirrors folding area and logos if they included or not, mechanical technician may be needed also.
For wheels too, what exactly included in to wheels service may differ btw shops, so it must be specified as well.

I did Crystalline 70, where Maui Jims and I can't remember the brand for the prescription glasses, both are polarized though.

Rarely notice ""rainbow"", although close by black vehicles, tires, and black tar on the road looks slightly purple. That might be an effect due to my wrap's color?

On a very clear blue, sunny sky I can see wide bands of color in the sky if I tilt my head to the side. Otherwise I see maybe part of the sky slightly lighter blue than to the sides. It is pretty noticeable against scattered white clouds though, as they are exempt from any shift in the hue. I only really see it though when I'm on mind numbing flat, straight, horizon drives. So a little visual spice is probably a good thing.

No ""rainbow"" on went roads, or anything. Which is a little out of character for the Maui Jims, there might actually be a little cancelation there?

I don't have autopilot, and have collision detection set to the default of ""Medium."" M3 has firmware version 2019.16.2.

These alarms normally occur around curves on streets without lane makings, when approaching parked cars, but occasionally occur when (safely, from my perspective) approaching a stopped car on a straight, fully marked road.

These events have resulted in nothing more than a startling alarm, and I have considered it a small price to pay for potentially avoiding an accident. Until today. 

This morning I was rounding a curve on a three lane, well marked road (40 MPH speed limit). Two semis occupied the two oncoming lanes. The closest truck was about a foot or so within its lane, and definitely not crossing into oncoming traffic.

The collision alert sounded, but this time the car moderately swerved into the narrow bike lane to the right of my single lane, and a ""Collision avoidance activated"" (or similar) message briefly appeared. I was able to wrest control back, and return to my lane. 

I believe the following statements are accurate:

1) The M3 falsely perceived an imminent collision. All vehicles were well within their lanes, and no threat existed.
2) The M3 responded to this misperception by moderately (not aggressively) swerving the car out of its lane, into a narrow bike lane. 
3) From examining the Autopilot menu settings, I don't see a way of turning off the side collision avoidance behavior. If there's not a way, I own a car that has faulty situational awareness, and could take control of the steering at any time based on incorrect conclusions, without prior warning.

1) Can the M3 can reliably detect people or bicycles? If it cannot, there's an obvious problem with the above behavior. It's poor etiquette to run over a bicyclist to avoid a collision with another ""exoskeletal"" vehicle, IMO.

2) Will the car be able to reliably detect situations where there is no shoulder? Or will it swerve into the ditch, or worse?

They're evaluating all cost savings possible. The homelink isn't cheap from any mfger, and $300 is cheaper than most vehicles charge for it. Not everyone needs it, not everyone has a garage or gate. It makes sense to make it optional and they benefit from raising margins.

Additionally, this is $300 after the fact, which includes labor for install. So Tesla is charging maybe $200 or $250 for it.

Welcome to California: Still a Shoplifter's Paradise? - Loss Prevention Media
""

Interesting... Criminals in organized gangs appear to be well aware of the lax laws and lack of punishment for their crimes in California. 

Proposition 47 has had a direct and profound negative effect on retailers. Retailers and law enforcement officials state that since shoplifting below $950 is now a misdemeanor, it means shoplifters face no pursuit and no punishment. Sources quote some large California retailers such as Safeway, Target, Rite Aid and CVS as saying that shoplifting has increased at least 15 percent, and in some cases, doubled. LAPD reported that shoplifting reports jumped by 25 percent in the first full year of the new law.

Prosecutors, police and retailers, including California Retailer’s Association President Bill Dombrowski and CVS Health Spokesman Mike DeAngelis, say that one of the main problems is organized retail crime rings, whose members are well aware of the reduced penalties. The law didn’t account for that, according to Captain John Romero of LAPD’s commercial crimes division. “The law did not give an exception for organized retail crime activities,” said Romero. “We are seeing these offenders benefiting, and the retailers are paying the price.”

In addition, California is currently one of 17 states without an organized retail theft law that specifically targets organized shoplifting rings with tougher penalties. Fresno Police Sergeant Mike Hudson says that while in theory, misdemeanors can bring up to a year in county jail, “it’s not worth it to issue a citation or arrest a shoplifting suspect who would likely be released immediately because of overcrowding.” Robin Shakely, Sacramento County assistant chief deputy district attorney, said that “we’ve heard of cases where shoplifters are going into stores with a calculator so they can make sure that what they steal is worth less than $950.”",,0,0,0,0

And I would like any updates to provide easily readable text and fonts on the screens, as existed in versions 6 and 7. Tesla provided such an easily readable UI in versions up to version 8. There is no reason they needed to “break” that readability other than the UI in versions 8 and 9 was designed by twenty something year olds that have “perfect” eyesight and can not imagine their color selections causing older individuals difficulty. One thing is certain, if you don’t die prematurely (I’m not wishing that to anyone), you will find your ability to distinguish text in foreground color “A” on a background color “B” to change as you age. That’s part of life.

Contrast Test:

I have my Chevrolet Spark EV at work today as well, and I was moving it to get some free charge as well:

1) I left my key on the ground outside the car about 1 foot away, left the door open.
2) Pressed brake pedal, tried to turn on the ""ignition"" with the pushbutton start
3) Nothing happened - ding, ding, ding - error message saying ""key not detected""
""

Final follow up on this, contrasting:

The Chevy Spark EV requires the following to move the vehicle:

1) The key has to be IN the vehicle, not near it.
2) The brake must be depressed, and concurrently the start button must be pressed. The start button does not work or do anything if the brake is not pressed.
3) The brake must be pressed, the button on the shift lever must be pressed, and the shift knob must be moved to reverse (or whatever). The button on the lever cannot be pressed if the brake is not also pressed.

I have chatted, emailed, tried to talk to service centers and service people on the phone and have asked a manager to call me. Still, no one has called me.
I emailed the first time on May 5th or so. No answer. I emailed again on May 12th. Again, no answer. I tried to do chat on my computer but it wouldn't link up- numerous times. I was finally able to chat with someone around the 20th on my phone app. He promised a manager would call me within a couple of days. It's been two weeks and still no call.I exchanged emails asking for a manager to call me- still nothing. I chatted again with someone else and was told that the managers have a list of people to call and they would get to me when/if they can. Seriously?!?

Thanks for sharing... that's a really good feature to have to avoid the dirty sock smells.
""

Serious question here: Along with the noisy fan in my garage which I have also experienced after drives parked in my garage, I believe I am for the first time after almost 1 year of ownership experiencing musty/ weird smells upon re-entering the vehicle. I have noticed this mainly after being parked somewhere for about 30-90 mins in between drives and then re-entering the car, it kind of smells really weird, then it will go away after a bit with the A/C running and recirculating, etc. 

I did not experience this musty kind of smell prior to around update 12.1.2 and now I am on 16.2. I believe it started happening around the same time as the loud fan while parked. Is anyone experiencing the funky smells inside your car too? Also, it has been raining pretty good here in Houston in May so I thought initially, I had some water seep inside the vehicle, but I could not determine that to be the case. However, it rained again hard this afternoon and I smelled it again this evening strongly. I am very confused.

Well, they are just flat out lying to you. People are placing orders every day for LR RWD vehicles and posting about it in this forum (and in this post). They found a car sitting around in inventory and want to move it so they fed you a line. If you are buying FSD anyway it doesn’t really matter, you will get HW3 eventually.

Not entirely sure this was a bad option for them. Looking more at the spreadsheet, out of the 20 people who ordered a LR in May, only 4 of them received a vin and got a delivery almost immediately. As you can imagine that probably just means they found an inventory match similar to wt31. So I'm definitely going to wait a while longer but probably unless those people see VINs within the next week I doubt I'll be getting mine before the July cut off date.

Well, they've really stepped to far this time. I am livid.

I've been actively rejecting V9.0 updates to my car since V8.1-2018.18. The last time my car had an update was over a year ago (see EV-FW info below).

But overnight my car got updated.. and much to my horror, shock, and surprise this morning when got in the car, I was greeted with the standard update notice and V9. 

Keep in mind that I got home with 11% charge and forgot to plug-in. And my car has not connected to Wi-fi in over a year. 

Now I'm not going to go into all ""entitled"" mode and say I'm going to sue Tesla or start a class-action lawsuit or assault the local service center to roll it back. Because (a) I'm not that kind of person, and (2), I know it's pointless.

I'm just stinking mad that I now have to suffer with the utter bullcrap software that is V9.

The only upside is that now I don't have to be afraid to go in for service. My charge port door was throwing some errors last week, but it resolved itself. Oh yeah, and Teslatari. Woot.

You should consider adding a consumption monitor. Either ask for the Solar Edge one, which is a bit pricey (cost me $500, but I asked for it after install was complete causing more labor). But it was worth every penny seeing production and consumption in the one app. One problem with it, is it does not report instantaneously, so it’s hard to track down wasted energy (still can be done, but it’s very tedious). But it’s extremely accurate and robust.

You could opt for an after market one too. I highly recommend Sense (you can buy it with or without solar) most Solar installations require the Solar option for it to work right. If they back feed the panel through a breaker you must get the Solar version ($350). Sense will report changes instantly. Once you have Solar, sometimes you become more neurotic over wasted energy. With a little thought you can save a ton. Especially if you monitor consumption. I probably could have put in a 25% smaller solar system and saved $8,000 or so had I cleaned up my waste with a monitor before hand. However, that over production I have now charges my car instead of the neighbors car.

@jhm, I think you’re really onto something with the link between the physical scale of these two technologies and the speed at which they change. After mulling it over, I have these thoughts.

In biology, there is a strong correlation between physical size and generation time. For example, in the time it takes for a single generation of elephants to be born, reproduce, and die, a population of bacteria associated with those same elephants will go through hundreds of thousands of generations. At each generation, all the variants composing the population will experience selection and other evolutionary forces - some variants will die, some may reproduce more quickly than others - and the next generation will have a different pool of variation than the last, perhaps better adapted to prevailing conditions. This means that organisms with short generation times can evolve much more quickly than organisms with long generation times: beneficial variation can spread very quickly while harmful variation can be purged very quickly. Kind of a similar idea to the Silicon Valley ethos of “Move fast and break things”.

I think a good analog of “generation time” for solar pv and wind might be the duration of individual project timelines for each technology. I did a cursory search and found some evidence that seems to confirm our suspicion that wind takes longer to get up and running than solar. I imagine there’s a ton of variation based on project size/specific technology deployed, but this source suggests wind project timelines on the order of a year or several years, and this CleanTechnica article cites NREL data for solar pv showing a median of 53 days (with a lot of variation). If that’s even close to accurate, I’ll channel Elon by observing that there’s a gap of at least one order of magnitude (and perhaps two) between the project timelines for these two technologies. I’d bet solar’s faster descent of the cost curve than wind can be partly explained by that difference in project timeline length. With shorter project timelines, new innovations in pv technology can be introduced and evaluated by the market more quickly. With the market imposing such strong selection for the lowest possible $/kwh lessons learned from each project can spread very rapidly.

More individual solar projects than wind projects?
I couldn’t find data on this in a quick search - most of the information about both solar and wind capacity is reported in terms of total installed GW installed - but I would bet that there are more individual solar projects installed each year than individual wind projects, and I would bet it’s also linked to the physical scale of each technology. If that’s true, it may also help explain the faster learning rate in solar relative to wind. As the data @winfield100 presents illustrates, wind may have deployed more GW of capacity, but from an evolutionary perspective, the number of independent projects for each technology may matter more than the total number of installed GW.

Selection is more efficient in larger population sizes than in smaller population sizes (well, technically effective population sizes, but I don’t think the distinction is critical for this analogy). The basic idea is that in small populations, evolutionary mechanisms other than selection (such as migration, or random effects like a natural disaster) make a larger relative contribution in determining what traits are passed on to the next generation than they do in large populations. This means that small populations may respond to selection less strongly than expected or even evolve in the opposite direction of selection. Imagine two populations of birds, one with 10 individuals and one with 1,000. The individuals in each population are 50% blue and 50% red, and selection favors red birds (i.e. red birds have more offspring on average). Say a storm randomly kills half of each population. Color frequencies in the larger population will probably still be in the neighborhood of 50-50, but in the small population it’s not improbable that say, 4 red and 1 blue bird die, leaving you with 80% blue and 20% red. Similarly, if you introduce 5 blue migrants to each population, it won’t appreciably change the color frequencies in the larger population, and the addition will probably get drowned out by selection for red birds. But in the smaller population you end up with 2/3 blue and 1/3 red. In both cases, despite selection for red coloration, the smaller population evolves in the opposite direction towards a higher frequency of blue birds.

For solar and wind I can imagine a number of extrinsic factors that may run counter to selection imposed by the market for the lowest $/kwh. Corruption, natural disasters, unexpected tariffs, counter-productive policy decisions, etc. A larger “population size” of solar projects may minimize the impact of these factors, allowing selection solar pv down the cost curve faster than wind. Come to think of it, this line of reasoning may also help explain why technologies like nuclear generation seem to get more costly over time. Evolution produces sub-optimal outcomes pretty regularly, often related to the reasons discussed above.

Both of these attributes - shorter project timelines and larger number of individual projects - also introduce more opportunities for “mutations” to arise. Every time someone starts a project, they might try something new or do things a little differently, either intentionally or as the result of a mistake. The more independent projects in total, the more variation can arise. Very rarely these mistakes or little experiments might result in Eureka! moments that are analogous to a beneficial mutation in some biological population. I don’t have any specific examples for solar pv in mind, and perhaps that’s not how it really works with these projects, but it seems like reasonable speculation.

So, yeah, I agree that there are definitely some fundamental differences between these two technologies that end up really favoring photovoltaics over wind when it comes to how quickly each improves.

A tangentially related side-note to a discussion about wind vs. solar technology that I find interesting: I can think of a lot of indirect ways that organisms have evolved to harvest wind energy: birds gliding on air currents, dispersal of seeds and pollen, spiders catching wind-driven prey in their webs, etc., but I don’t think there’s a single example of an organism that has evolved a mechanism by which to directly convert wind energy into chemical energy. That’s in stark contrast to photosynthesis, which is obviously the foundation of (nearly) every food web on earth. Maybe there’s a lesson there.
""

Cool. That's some really elegant thinking. Generation cycle length and project size differences become even more pronounced looking at other generation technologies. What I've seen as some stylized figures is that PV solar and battery storage project take less than a year to develop, wind about 2 years, natural gas 6 year, coal 8-10 years, and nuclear 12 or more years. Nuclear and coal are very large scale projects requiring large scale grids for distribution, while solar and batteries can be exceedingly small serving nanogrids, like small cabin in the woods small. In the time, it would take for a new nuclear project to start generating power, solar and battery storage could be 90% cheaper. The larger scale projects generally require much more political engagement and public commitment, which of course create much more opportunity for political corruption to emerge. So the scale and glacial pace of nuclear I believe are principle drivers of what appears to be a negative experience curve. Basically in real dollars nuclear has become more expensive as it has scaled. The Vogtle 3&4 project in Georgia is looking at the levelized cost of around $230/MWh. This is in a time when natural gas is under $60/MWh and integrated wind+solar+battery PPAs are pushing below $50/MWh. The only way to put such ghastly expensive power on market is to use political power to force the public to pay for it. So, you bet, there is some pretty gamey politics at play.

I don't really follow your thinking. People have been buying cars from the big iron companies for many decades. The Japanese showed us all how to make reliable cars and now literally every significant car company in the world makes similar products that they sell the same way to the same people. Clearly there is no problem with the greater auto industry in being able to sell cars to the masses. They didn't sell electric cars because they are much more conservative than a silicon valley start up company and typically would stick their toe in the water first. Tesla did what they said they were going to do, spur the advancement of EVs. 

Now every major car company is pushing ahead to produce EVs. These companies are well capitalized, have good engineering and most importantly know exactly how to sell cars to the public. That is why they will have many models and market them through advertising and display them in their showrooms. They will sell to the other 99%. If Tesla wants to be able to compete in 100% of the market space, they will need to do a lot that they just aren't capable of doing. Having service centers 200 miles apart won't cut it. Having crowding at their chargers won't cut it. Continually cutting back on service and support won't cut it. 

To compare this to selling cell phones is rather disingenuous. Cell phones are inexpensive items that are all about the tech and the glitter. The glitter and tech in autos may attract people to showrooms, but in reality they want transportation. The big iron companies know how to deliver that. Apple virtually invented the smart phone. They didn't start out with a tiny share of the market with enormous barriers to ramping up production. As I put this down in writing, I realize I've been fooling myself into thinking Tesla has much chance to make it in the long haul. They will never have dealers or repair centers in small cities or towns. They will likely never complete the network of superchargers enough to eliminate the crowding and long lines in key areas. They will never have enough models to effectively compete with the big iron. There is a reason why there have been no successful automotive startups in how many decades.
""

What is not cutting it are the attitude toward electric cars these legacy auto makers have. They are only talking about going full EV to satisfy shareholders, regulators, and prevent people from jumping into what is available today. In reality not one manufacture have any solid plans to do so. Where are the charging infrastructure? Where are they going to source their batteries? What are they doing about software? What are their plans for ICE part distributers? 

Tesla is the only company that is doing ev right with the fasted pace of innovation. The other manufactures are trying to half ass their way into the EV space because it's an expensive endeavor while already working on razor thin margins in their entire portfolio stack.

I think the premise here is that compressed hydrogen has 200x higher energy density than lithium ion battery(one reference says 142 MJ/kg versus 0.6 MJ/kg), so instead of heavy batteries at storage, and heavy batteries on each car, hydrogen can be a medium of stored energy without the extra weight. 

Just imagine the amount of energy wasted to carry a 1000+ pounds of battery pack around that does not shrink in weight, and multiply that by 100 million cars traveling 10000 miles each year. If that weight is reduced by half(including hydrogen fuel + equipment), it can be significant energy savings.

We don't have enough batteries today to store all the energy we need for night-time use. We don't have enough fuel-cells today to utilize H2 for night-time energy use. But it's a straw man to say that batteries are not the answer because we don't have enough of them today. Any change in our energy system takes time. Tesla is building batteries far faster than all the other car companies combined are building fuel cells. So we'll have enough batteries to store the electricity long before we'll have enough fuel cells to use H2 for the equivalent storage.

Note also, that for grid storage, weight does not matter.

And there are other methods of energy storage. Where there's a sufficient slope of land, pumped hydro is far more efficient than H2. Of all the ways to store energy, H2 is the most inefficient, and of all the ways to convert stored potential energy into usable electricity, fuel cells are the most expensive.

Just imagine the amount of energy wasted to carry a 1000+ pounds of battery pack around that does not shrink in weight, and multiply that by 100 million cars traveling 10000 miles each year. If that weight is reduced by half(including hydrogen fuel + equipment), it can be significant energy savings.

If carbon is toxic for the earth it needs to be banned. You can't put a tax to stop murder.
""

Carbon is only ""toxic"" at sufficiently high levels of concentration. Murder is ""toxic"" at any level of concentration. So with carbon the challenge is how we scale back quickly and in a way that poses minimal cost to the economy. Banning carbon before there is an economic alternative will put the economy at risk and for this reason engender political back lash. It does little good for one government to impose bans in one election cycle only to find their members run out of office by the next election cycle. The replacement government can come in and do more policy damage than the earlier government was able to put into place. This is also the chief vulnerability of a carbon tax. It is not so much that it is regressive, but that political opponents can use the alleged harm to poor people, labor, or whatever as a political wedge issue dismantle political support for any sort of strong policy response to the climate crisis. Australia is a poster child for a carbon tax that was quickly dismantled within the next election cycle. So the really tough problem is how do you put forward meaningful climate policy that does not run your party out of office in the next election cycle. Whether you ban it or just tax it out of the market, you still need to stay in power long enough for it to do some real good.",,0,0,0,0

Sorry, disagree. You have an RWD and are trying to justify your purchase. If the RWD was sufficient, Tesla wouldn't bother selling a dual motor variant, it has its purpose as does AWD. Calgary and Alberta are terrible for driving conditions and risking it is beyond silly.
""

Not trying to justify anything. Love the Model 3 and absolutely no regrets about the RWD. Prior to this my favorite winter car was a Subaru Outback. I prefer the Model 3. RWD and all. 

I know a thing or two about winter driving. Learned to drive in Northern Alberta in a RWD Toyota Celica. Also spent four years in Waterloo, ON where the frequent freezing rains and lake effect snowfalls were far worse than anything Alberta winters dish out. Drove a RWD Corolla in those days, although I mostly rode my bike. Never put on winter tires in those days either. 

Before getting my Model 3 I went to a few Drive Electric events hosted by EVAA and talked to owners about their RWD winter driving experiences and without exception they all said their Model S RWD vehicles were the best winter vehicles they'd ever had. Hopefully one or two will swing by here and chime in. 

I spent this last winter pushing the Model 3, trying to find its limits in the snow (when no others were around - no point putting others at risk). In Alberta. The car is amazing. Floor it going around a corner and you feel just the tiniest slip then the traction control takes over and safely navigates the corner. What's your experience driving a RWD Tesla in the snow?

As to why they sell AWD: More power delivery to the wheels with all the wheels being powered. Faster acceleration. Buyers like you who think they need it. Slightly better traction in some very rare conditions. Image. Better profit margins.",,0,0,0,0

Thanks for the feedback.

Arbitrary numbers below conceptually reflecting actual bill at annual settlement. Are my calculations and conclusions correct?

TOU: Yes
Total @ consumer rate: -$500
Net Surplus: -2000 kWh (generation to grid)
Net Surplus Compensation @ 0.04: $80 (2000 * 0.04)
Monthly Mandatory Charge for 12 months @ $10/month: $120

- Total annual liability to my utility is $40 (120 - 80).
- Size of total consumer rate, if reflecting a credit, is irrelevant to my bottom line.
- Monthly mandatory charge is NOT offset by monthly net generation at consumer rate.
- Should target to have a Net Surplus to cover the mandatory charge.
- For simplicity, self-powered mode, is the ""better"" option given difference in consumer rate I pay and the surplus rate paid by my utility.
""

Generally, you've got it. One more nuance, or should I say nuisance? If you have a recent solar system on PG&E or SoCal Edison, you will be on NEM 2.0 which also has Non-Bypassable Charges. So, even if you have 2,000 kWh surplus generation, you will owe a small amount for every kWh that you take from the grid that cannot be offset by your generation. So, let's say you use about 500kWh/mo charging your car during overnight hours. You will owe about 1 cent/kWh (made up number, I've never been able to figure out the exact calculation) so you will owe about $5/mo more, in addition to the $10/mo minimum delivery charges.

So, if you are a Powerwall customer and you are truly a net surplus generator, arbitrage means nothing to your bottom line, so you will save the most by running in Self-Powered Mode to reduce your NBC's. You will also save more by charging directly from your solar as much as possible.",,0,0,0,0

Think of Carbon as DDT. When you ban something, you don't need to ban right away. You give it time - 10 years. For eg., coal power plants are being banned, ICE is being banned - all with some sunset date. Much more direct and clear policy than putting some tax and hoping that will reduce emissions enough.

I see. But the ban still has to be a credible threat. I'm not sure how a ten-year ban that has a good chance of being revoked before it ever takes effect is supposed to make much of difference. You can at least count on your opposition chipping away at it for the next ten ye
I know this is how these ICE bans out in 2030 or later are supposed to work today. But it seem that the man thing that makes this a credible threat is that EVs are becoming incredibly competitive. So long as car buyers are turning on to EV you can expect growing support for such a policy. But if car buyers just never become energized about EVs, the policy would become incredibly unpopular. 

This is why I've never been all that enthusiastic about ICE bans. They only have staying power if EVs keep taking substantial market share from ICEVs. In this case, the policy itself does little more than simply allow a competitive market forces run their course.",,0,0,0,0

Do we think there's any chance of entire edge-cases being learned by the neural network?

Going back to the ""how do humans learn to drive"" question, I don't think I was ever taught how to respond to a single-lane bridge (e.g. FSD Use Case 1 - Single Lane Bridge). I just slowed down, observed what other people did in that scenario, and quickly learned you take turns.

With fleet learning, could the neural network learn entire scenarios? If the network has seen how human drivers respond to seeing a yield sign and a narrowing of the road-space, could it perform an entire maneuver when confronted with a similar situation? Or will the neural network always just be relegated to parsing what the cameras see, with traditional software doing the responding?
""

Based on current state of the art, no. I do deployments of ML software, including many NN-based applications, to enterprise. I've never seen anything but theory on this topic.

As you point out, machine vision is only one half of the equation. You need to feed the context into a control system to actually make a decision and take action. The control system for lane keeping in AP looks like a simplistic PID right now. I dont think a simple heuristic based control system is scalable or flexible enough to respond to novel situations. Theoretically there are several actions that can be taken based on the environmental context identified by the vision system. And si ideally they would optimize the action (what and how much) via some sort of learning like RL, but I saw no discussion of that. RL is extremely difficult to implement, and would likely require many many more entire models to make work.

This is of course approaching discussion of artificial general intelligence. And again I dont know if AGI is required, or if the sum of far lesser point solutions is adequate. 

Andrej talked about using human inputs as a solution when he discussed cut ins (which reminds me of AlviNN), but again that is not scalable and only works for point solutions.

What is not cutting it are the attitude toward electric cars these legacy auto makers have. They are only talking about going full EV to satisfy shareholders, regulators, and prevent people from jumping into what is available today. In reality not one manufacture have any solid plans to do so. Where are the charging infrastructure? Where are they going to source their batteries? What are they doing about software? What are their plans for ICE part distributers?
""

I'm glad you mentioned the charging network. I have always said that is Tesla's big advantage for at least 2 years and maybe 4. I expect you are aware of Electrify America which is building a network with a significant number of charging locations? They already have some number of stations and are building many more. GM recently announced they will be partnering with Bechtel to build a significant charging network. Building the network doesn't really take so much time if you have the money which companies like Volkswagen and GM do. GM has invited others to partner and add to the plan. 

I seem to recall someone saying GM gets their batteries from a Korean company, but I'm not sure. Or that might be the supplier of the motors in the Bolt. Perhaps you don't recall they have been making a hybrid for years, the Volt. It's not like GM is sitting on their hands. As I've said, conservative companies like GM don't jump in with both feet like a startup with nothing to lose. Also, GM is right in there with autonomous driving software. I forget the Asian company they are partnering with, but of all the other companies, GM is supposed to be the most advanced. 

I have no idea what you are referring to about the ICE distributors. If you mean the dealers, why wouldn't they sell the electric cars? 




Tesla is the only company that is doing ev right with the fasted pace of innovation. The other manufactures are trying to half ass their way into the EV space because it's an expensive endeavor while already working on razor thin margins in their entire portfolio stack. This is why in 2019 there are no cars that can beat a Tesla from 2012. Just a lot of fake promises.

1. I'm not sure what cars caught on fire and I'm not going to research that tonight
2. I'm not sure if your description of pack changes is accurate in regards to when or what changed.

But one thing I will address now is your nosecone fixation is misleading. You are talking about 2012, 2013, and maybe some 2014 cars if I understand correctly but the nosecone doesn't go away until some time in 2016. So by focusing in so many posts about cars with nosecones having some flaw you are painting the majority of the nosecone cars that don't have that issue with a broad brush.

By the nature of Tesla selling more cars each year at an exponential rate there more cars sold after your cutoff point with a nosecone than cars sold before that point with a nosecone.

I still don't know if you are correct about the underlying issues but you should stop focusing on the nosecone and start finding a better way to specify what you are referring to.",,0,0,0,0

I'm glad you mentioned the charging network. I have always said that is Tesla's big advantage for at least 2 years and maybe 4. I expect you are aware of Electrify America which is building a network with a significant number of charging locations? They already have some number of stations and are building many more. GM recently announced they will be partnering with Bechtel to build a significant charging network. Building the network doesn't really take so much time if you have the money which companies like Volkswagen and GM do. GM has invited others to partner and add to the plan.

I seem to recall someone saying GM gets their batteries from a Korean company, but I'm not sure. Or that might be the supplier of the motors in the Bolt. Perhaps you don't recall they have been making a hybrid for years, the Volt. It's not like GM is sitting on their hands. As I've said, conservative companies like GM don't jump in with both feet like a startup with nothing to lose. Also, GM is right in there with autonomous driving software. I forget the Asian company they are partnering with, but of all the other companies, GM is supposed to be the most advanced.

I have no idea what you are referring to about the ICE distributors. If you mean the dealers, why wouldn't they sell the electric cars?




No one promised anything. Now GM is saying they will have a full lineup of models by 2023. Volkswagen is bringing out EVs, many other companies have announced products due out in a very few years. No fake. They just didn't jump in with both feet like a startup with nothing to lose. It is not unlike WWII where America was the giant having been awaken.

What do you mean no fakes? Look at the Hyundai ev, not sold pretty much everywhere except a few states. The bolt is pretty much a spark converted. I like how they took Ev seriously by converting their ugliest and least desirable car model.

And what about electrify America? Who knows about it? Is it fast? Does the general public even know they exist? What are companies doing about software? Tesla is partnering with Netflix and most likely will start monitizing apps via movies and games..are ev companies doing this because not everyone wants to get coffee while charging.

Like I said, Tesla is doing this correctly and other companies are lackluster and it shows.


I mean about parts oem are the partnership and reliance other car companies have since they have little vertical integration. Will they lose bargining power once they convert to ev? Where are they going to outsource EV parts and battery packs?

There is a problem here and that is that not everyone agreed to the Terms if Service you are referring to. I for one never received any such Terms of Service and (hence) never agreed to such terms.

I reserved my car when they first announced the Model S. I was the 251 reservation placed for the car. I signed a reservation form online and paid my reservation fee, and then waited and waited and waited to they started making the car. I then signed a contract that contained no Terms of Service or my thing else other than indicating the options and features of the car. When the car was delivered I did an ACH transfer from my account to Tesla’s account. That was it. No Terms of Service was provided to read, to sign or to do anything with.

Now, to make things more interesting, that car had issues from day 1. After Tesla couldn’t resolve the problem (it would go to sleep on its own and become totally unresponsive) Elob’s office Telephoned me saying he wanted the car back so they could strip it down to try to find the problem. I had already received the title from the DMV. I gave the second key fob to Tesla (handshake, no paperwork involved), and about a month later a new car was handed to me. There was no paperwork signed by me regarding the second car. The first car was never officially transferred back to Tesla and hence, 2 titles for two different VINs are still recorded with the DMV.

Tesla stock is not going up for a very long time. There has been to much damage from Elon’s overpromising and underdelivering. In the context of Trump, tariffs, and current market conditions, the stock is a no win situation in the short term. I love the company and I think the stock will eventually thrive but the only way the market will appreciate the true value of this company is when they see Audi, Mercedes, and the other car companies start to feel the pain from lost market share. Then it will be obvious but that may take time. Probably a couple years. For your own sanity, don’t have high short term expectations and keep somewhat diversified. I keep only 7% of my net worth in this crazy company and I’m pretty relaxed these days. I like real estate because you aren’t aware of the price on a daily basis.

Probably it makes sense for me to set up a small webpage so anyone who is interested can order a set and I can ship them out, and keep organized that way. These are specifically for the front dash mid-range speakers, and should work for all 3 locations there. The way I have designed them is to use zip-ties to hold the two screw-slot locations on the Infiinity speakers, since a screw cannot be used there without drilling through the Tesla, but the other 3 screw locations fit right into factory spots using factory screws. The bracket allows full mounting of the speakers, then, and provides a little spacing as well to lift the magnet off the frame slightly. I am printing them out in PETG which should handle the automotive environment without degrading (specifically temperature change and moisture) and making them slightly flexible so the speaker bracket on the passenger side can slide underneath an oddly placed clip in the Tesla dash. 

I have tested these on my car and all is well there; I assume for the moment that all the Tesla Model 3s are using the same physical parameters for the front dash speakers, but I am very curious to have someone test these on an interior other than the Premium (what I am testing on). I have not yet decided fully on a price for ordering (depends on how efficiently I can set up printing and shipping), but it will likely be $15-$20 for a pair (with zip ties and a promise to replace anything that is not fitting your car for whatever reason). I will be making plugs to go into the factory harness as well, hopefully this week. Then it is on to the front door woofers.

Man. I'm really surprised by the backlash I'm getting. And I refuse to back down. You exchanged money for a device. You are now the owner of a device. Hack it. Burn it to the ground. Drive it off a cliff. It is your device. No one else is obligated to help you or provide you any service. If you would like to use a service (the warranty, the LTE, the maps, the music) then you enter into a contract. In this case a contract between the owner of a vehicle and its manufacturer. That agreement is bilateral and requires both parties to hold up their respective ends of the deal. The owners end is that Tesla can basically use the data they collect for any purpose and alter the software in the car any way they see fit. You get all the cool stuff that literally no other car company in the world provides (see earlier list). If you want V8 or V5 or Ubuntu or make your car into a sculpture; cool. If you want to drive your car with all those cool service based features, then you need to accept they are going to alter the software on your car as they see fit.

I feel like the entitlement in this thread is insane. Bunch of rich kids with their fancy toys bitching about how they had the world's most advanced software forced upon them. ""Mommy! Mommy! Elon forced me to look at a big free map instead of a small one in my $90k sedan."" Again, just stop.

What I don't agree with is people feeling like they're entitled to a service that they are not paying for. If you purposely keep your car on a deprecated version of the software while using Tesla services; you are not holding your end of the deal up. It is nothing but entitlement to believe that you can break the service contract and still expect the service. Pure and simple. If you use Tesla provided services, then they can literally brick your MCU if they feel like it.

I wish you would stop. You are using the LTE service, Google maps, the music, supercharging, etc? Then you are using something that costs Tesla money. You want those services for free. You want to use those services but not accept that Tesla will change the software that connects to those services. If you want v8, DONT USE TESLA SERVICES! Otherwise don't complain. You're like those guys who rebuild salvaged Tesla's and then complain that supercharging and LTE doesn't work. Tesla services cost them money. Your exchange of money for a product ended when you drove off the lot. Everything else is a service contract and you don't want to hold your end up.
""

You must be really new here, because you keep harping on this one singular assertion. What you obviously don't know, and don't understand is that Tesla has always intended to charge people for broadband wireless access for the browser, nav, maps, and streaming services. If people did not sign up to pay for those services, they wouldn't get them. Plain and simple. But Tesla always maintains their own broadband access to the car -- at NO COST TO THE OWNER for telemetry, software updates, service and maintenance, and other required services necessary to maintain a connection to the car for basic services.

They've always said there will be these two tiers of services. One you PAY FOR, and one you do not. So please, stop this nonsense about getting ""something for nothing"" and that since I'm getting these services for free, I AM REQUIRED to bend over and grab my ankles for Tesla to ""send me updates"" unannounced and without warning, leaving my car completely immobilized at at time when I might need it. Please, just stop.

The issue is that Tesla never got around to separating these two distinct services and charging people for them. They kind of half hearted tried to with ""premium connectivity"", but it's never really amounted to much. The one-year grace period expires next month and for a while it was a referral award. It's yet to be seen if they'll actually start charging people for it. The FAQ is still pretty vague: Frequently Asked Questions - Connectivity I suspect they'll decide for yet another year (it's been five years already) that it's more expensive to maintain a billing system, than it is to just pay the broadband bill for everyone for both tiers of service.

I don't know why some people keep saying that there's no way a two year old could put the car in drive. They absolutely could. My Model X got hit by a DUI driver a few weeks ago so I'm waiting on the replacement, but I test fit my very own two year old in my Model 3 and he could easily easily put it in drive. The Model X is bigger, certainly, but it still would be super easy for him to do. For a kid to do this, you don't have to be sitting on the seat. A two year old can stand on the floor and hit the pedal and pull the lever, they can hang off the steering wheel, they can sit on the floor and press the lever and reach up high enough (In a model 3 or S, the X might be too high for that).

But they definitely could do it. And on the model X, And trigger the seat sensor too (It's very sensitive). In fact the second I put him in the car, this is how he sat down so he could hit brake and I have no doubt leaving my little troublemaker in the for more than a minute or two unsupervised he *would* have hit the brake and pulled to stock to try to put it into gear. And it's why we never let the kids play inside the cars (any cars, ever, not just the Teslas.)

If your phone is connected to the cars bluetooth and you're NOT using the audio source from the phone, you will not hear any alerts as (iPhone in my case) the phone try to play the alerts through the bluetooth like you're wearing a headset. My apple watch will ding me for text messages but any emails or anything else I get I don't notice until I stop and get out of the car. No known way to work around this short of not connecting your phone via bluetooth but then you can't use the car to make/receive calls so it's a lose/lose situation...

Correlation is not causation. Correlation does not imply causation - Wikipedia



You must be really new here, because you keep harping on this one singular assertion. What you obviously don't know, and don't understand is that Tesla has always intended to charge people for broadband wireless access for the browser, nav, maps, and streaming services. If people did not sign up to pay for those services, they wouldn't get them. Plain and simple. But Tesla always maintains their own broadband access to the car -- at NO COST TO THE OWNER for telemetry, software updates, service and maintenance, and other required services necessary to maintain a connection to the car for basic services.

They've always said there will be these two tiers of services. One you PAY FOR, and one you do not. So please, stop this nonsense about getting ""something for nothing"" and that since I'm getting these services for free, I AM REQUIRED to bend over and grab my ankles for Tesla to ""send me updates"" unannounced and without warning, leaving my car completely immobilized at at time when I might need it. Please, just stop.

The issue is that Tesla never got around to separating these two distinct services and charging people for them. They kind of half hearted tried to with ""premium connectivity"", but it's never really amounted to much. The one-year grace period expires next month and for a while it was a referral award. It's yet to be seen if they'll actually start charging people for it. The FAQ is still pretty vague: Frequently Asked Questions - Connectivity I suspect they'll decide for yet another year (it's been five years already) that it's more expensive to maintain a billing system, than it is to just pay the broadband bill for everyone for both tiers of service.

Just stop.
""

Woah... we must be talking way over each other. Premium connectivity? Is that like a net neutrality thing?

We still seem to be talking past each other, my argument has nothing to do with money or ""premium stuff."" Just saying that (and I know talking about cost without money is a hard concept) in exchange for not paying with currency for certain ongoing services (LTE, Maps, music, etc...) you give Tesla access to certain data and the ability to update your vehicle's software as they see fit. In my analysis, this seems reasonable. Google Maps, up-to-date navigation and safety improvements cost MILLIONS of dollars a month. So Tesla gives you something and in exchange you give them something. In common law, we call this a ""contract."" Two or more parties agree on terms.

This is what Tesla Service Center Eindhoven - The Netherlands advised me to do.
What I know, you can confirm the car is sleeping, when the airco stops working (and the very low background noise stops in the car). And when you try to hit the brake-pedal, it has very firm resistance, until the car gets out of sleep (that's what I experienced last two days). Curious if thee are other ways to know: the Tesla app on your phone cannot connect to the car, but that happens more often (no network connectivity, for example).
""

I saw your post, and have tried that, but was hoping to find a positive confirmation of sleep, since the amount of time we're expected to wait until it sleeps has been reported as anywhere from a few to 10 minutes, and I would really like to know for sure when I'm pulled over on the side of the road trying to reset it.  Granted, on my normal commute, I can live without it, but if I'm on a roadtrip, I definitely want AP and all my safety features. Good to know about the resistance in the pedal; I will look for that when I try to sleep the car.

It does seem like my car goes to sleep when it loses all network connectivity when it goes into the underground garage at work every day, but I guess there's no good way to confirm it's gone to sleep unless I stay in the car and test for brake pedal pressure.",,0,0,0,0

Yes, that is true. So maybe V3 chargers will help to relieve congestion by replacing V2 chargers. Still, I'm pretty sure a V3 charger can't just be swapped in for a V2. The entire facility would need to be upgraded as the connection to the utility is sized to the V2 chargers. So it is pretty much as expensive as adding that many chargers. Also, the station would be down for some time to get this done and the utility company can be very slow on their end with an upgrade.
""

Yeah, it's a huge undertaking. But in principle, there's no reason they can't add additional transformers to handle the extra capacity required, then convert it a piece at a time.

For example, if they have a supercharger on 3-phase 480V service at 150 kW per pair, at 312.5-ish amps per pair, they need roughly 1875A, so it probably has at least 2000A service (6 pairs * 300 amps).

For a V3 supercharger, they would need 250 kW per station, which turns out to be about 520 amps per station. So they could use the existing service to feed at least three V3 supercharger stations (and maybe four, depending on how accurate that 2000A guess is). If they wire up additional transformers, they could convert most of the stations a few at a time and add them to the new service, then wire up the last few stations to the old service.",,0,0,0,0
